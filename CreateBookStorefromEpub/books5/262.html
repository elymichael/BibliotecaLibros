"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to<br/>you the enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and<br/>have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never<br/>materially disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay<br/>you by a long preface.—We are quite well.— This letter has been the<br/>cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I<br/>did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial<br/>morning; and though you will never own being affected by weather, I<br/>think every body feels a north-east wind.— I felt for your dear<br/>father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday<br/>morning, but had the comfort of hearing last night, by Mr. Perry,<br/>that it had not made him ill.<br/><br/>"Yours ever,<br/><br/>"A. W."<br/><br/>[To Mrs. Weston.]<br/><br/>WINDSOR-JULY.<br/><br/>MY DEAR MADAM,<br/><br/>"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be<br/>expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour<br/>and indulgence.— You are all goodness, and I believe there will be<br/>need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past<br/>conduct.— But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to<br/>resent. My courage rises while I write. It is very difficult for<br/>the prosperous to be humble. I have already met with such success<br/>in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking<br/>myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have<br/>had any ground of offence.—You must all endeavour to comprehend the<br/>exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls; you<br/>must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all<br/>hazards. This was the fact. My right to place myself in a situation<br/>requiring such concealment, is another question. I shall not<br/>discuss it here. For my temptation to think it a right, I refer<br/>every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and<br/>casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my<br/>difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known<br/>to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,<br/>before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female<br/>mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—<br/>Had she refused, I should have gone mad.—But you will be ready to<br/>say, what was your hope in doing this?—What did you look forward<br/>to?— To any thing, every thing—to time, chance, circumstance, slow<br/>effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and<br/>sickness. Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of<br/>blessings secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and<br/>correspondence. If you need farther explanation, I have the honour,<br/>my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and the advantage of<br/>inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of<br/>houses or lands can ever equal the value of.—See me, then, under<br/>these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;—and<br/>here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner<br/>paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss<br/>Fairfax was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you<br/>will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's<br/>compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself<br/>from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My<br/>behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you,<br/>did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one<br/>point. And now I come to the principal, the only important part of<br/>my conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or<br/>requires very solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect,<br/>and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father<br/>perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.— A<br/>few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and<br/>some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss<br/>Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.— In order to<br/>assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more<br/>than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were<br/>immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my<br/>ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the declaration,<br/>that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would not have<br/>been induced by any selfish views to go on.— Amiable and delightful<br/>as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young woman<br/>likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any<br/>tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my<br/>wish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly,<br/>goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to<br/>understand each other. From our relative situation, those<br/>attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.—Whether Miss<br/>Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of<br/>that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called to take leave of her, I<br/>remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth, and I<br/>then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no doubt of<br/>her having since detected me, at least in some degree.— She may not<br/>have surmised the whole, but her quickness must have penetrated a<br/>part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the subject<br/>becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take her<br/>wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember<br/>her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for<br/>her attentions to Miss Fairfax.— I hope this history of my conduct<br/>towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great<br/>extenuation of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as<br/>having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from<br/>either. Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable,<br/>the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I<br/>regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as<br/>deeply and as happily in love as myself.— Whatever strange things I<br/>said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to. My heart<br/>was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as<br/>often as might be, and with the least suspicion. If you remember<br/>any queernesses, set them all to the right account.— Of the<br/>pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that<br/>its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would<br/>never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.—<br/>The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear<br/>madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon,<br/>I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.— No description can<br/>describe her. She must tell you herself what she is— yet not by<br/>word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly<br/>suppress her own merit.—Since I began this letter, which will be<br/>longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.— She gives a good<br/>account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not<br/>depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks. I know you will<br/>soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it<br/>is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient<br/>for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at<br/>Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much<br/>better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I<br/>think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence<br/>and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy: but<br/>when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how<br/>little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could<br/>but see her again!—But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been<br/>too good for me to encroach.—I must still add to this long letter.<br/>You have not heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give any<br/>connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light,<br/>the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs<br/>explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will<br/>conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should<br/>not have presumed on such early measures, but from the very<br/>particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I<br/>should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would<br/>have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and<br/>refinement.— But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had<br/>entered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to<br/>leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been<br/>walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to<br/>make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a<br/>most mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I<br/>can admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss<br/>F., were highly blameable. She disapproved them, which ought to<br/>have been enough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think<br/>sufficient.—She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I<br/>thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and<br/>cautious: I thought her even cold. But she was always right. If I<br/>had followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of<br/>what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the greatest<br/>unhappiness I have ever known.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the<br/>morning spent at Donwell?—There every little dissatisfaction that<br/>had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking<br/>home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she would not<br/>suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then thought<br/>most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very<br/>natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the<br/>world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable<br/>particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next<br/>to a proposal which might have made every previous caution<br/>useless?—Had we been met walking together between Donwell and<br/>Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.— I was mad enough,<br/>however, to resent.—I doubted her affection. I doubted it more the<br/>next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my side,<br/>such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion<br/>to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense<br/>to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly<br/>intelligible to me.— In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel<br/>blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same<br/>evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the<br/>next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as<br/>possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be<br/>reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her<br/>coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first<br/>advances.—I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of<br/>the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can<br/>hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its<br/>effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as<br/>soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with<br/>the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose<br/>treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation<br/>and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which<br/>has been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I<br/>should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has<br/>known.— `Jane,' indeed!—You will observe that I have not yet<br/>indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think,<br/>then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the<br/>Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the<br/>insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall<br/>soon have done.— She closed with this offer, resolving to break<br/>with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never<br/>were to meet again.— She felt the engagement to be a source of<br/>repentance and misery to each: she dissolved it.—This letter<br/>reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I answered<br/>it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the<br/>multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead<br/>of being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was<br/>locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written<br/>enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without<br/>any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from<br/>her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy,<br/>and—may I add?— too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We removed<br/>to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her,<br/>my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by<br/>the post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the<br/>smallest reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a<br/>point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally<br/>desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded<br/>as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my<br/>letters, and requested, that if I could not directly command hers,<br/>so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would forward them<br/>after that period to her at—: in short, the full direction to Mr.<br/>Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the name,<br/>the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been<br/>doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character<br/>which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as<br/>to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of<br/>its anxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to<br/>threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually<br/>detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.— What<br/>was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my uncle. Without<br/>his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.— I spoke;<br/>circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened away<br/>his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,<br/>wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!<br/>with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in<br/>the marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a<br/>different sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have<br/>suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was<br/>at stake?—No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how<br/>ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick<br/>looks.—I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my<br/>knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good<br/>chance of finding her alone.—I was not disappointed; and at last I<br/>was not disappointed either in the object of my journey. A great<br/>deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade<br/>away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than<br/>ever, and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.<br/>Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude<br/>before. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you<br/>have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart<br/>will dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier<br/>than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the<br/>child of good fortune. I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good<br/>fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,<br/><br/>Your obliged and affectionate Son,<br/><br/>F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
