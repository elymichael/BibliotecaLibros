<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in<br/>interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or<br/>dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.<br/><br/>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first<br/>mentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other,<br/>discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be<br/>handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and<br/>when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects,<br/>and circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more<br/>for him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose music<br/>she principally played.<br/><br/>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected<br/>and mortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series<br/>of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing<br/>the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very<br/>wrong one. He had gone away deeply offended—he came back engaged to<br/>another—and to another as superior, of course, to the first, as<br/>under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.<br/>He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing<br/>for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.<br/><br/>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual<br/>advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an<br/>independent fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called<br/>ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the<br/>story told well; he had not thrown himself away—he had gained a<br/>woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such<br/>delightful rapidity— the first hour of introduction had been so<br/>very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he<br/>had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so<br/>glorious—the steps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the<br/>dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's—smiles and<br/>blushes rising in importance— with consciousness and agitation<br/>richly scattered—the lady had been so easily impressed—so sweetly<br/>disposed—had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so<br/>very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally<br/>contented.<br/><br/>He had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and<br/>affection, and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only<br/>of himself and his own concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready<br/>to be laughed at—and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing<br/>all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he<br/>would have been more cautiously gallant.<br/><br/>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only<br/>themselves to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to<br/>wait for; and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general<br/>expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to<br/>contradict, that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his<br/>bride.<br/><br/>
