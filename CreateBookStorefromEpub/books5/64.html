<br/>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—<br/>You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."<br/><br/>"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr.<br/>Weston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take<br/>the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being<br/>a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal<br/>force. As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the<br/>convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she<br/>can."<br/><br/>"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in<br/>part.— "Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or<br/>can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had<br/>not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never<br/>have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the<br/>world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I<br/>think there is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of<br/>the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself<br/>and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never<br/>forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last<br/>Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September<br/>twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on<br/>purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I<br/>have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a<br/>better man in existence.—If any body can deserve him, it must be<br/>Miss Taylor."<br/><br/>"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley. "Has he been here<br/>on this occasion—or has he not?"<br/><br/>"He has not been here yet," replied Emma. "There was a strong<br/>expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in<br/>nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."<br/><br/>"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her<br/>father. "He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate<br/>her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to<br/>me. I thought it very well done of him indeed. Whether it was his<br/>own idea you know, one cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle,<br/>perhaps—"<br/><br/>"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time<br/>passes."<br/><br/>"Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought<br/>it— and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!<br/>Well, time does fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it<br/>was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston<br/>a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth,<br/>and dated Sept. 28th—and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how<br/>it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'— I remember<br/>that perfectly."<br/><br/>"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted<br/>Mrs. John Knightley. "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable<br/>young man. But how sad it is that he should not live at home with<br/>his father! There is something so shocking in a child's being taken<br/>away from his parents and natural home! I never could comprehend<br/>how Mr. Weston could part with him. To give up one's child! I<br/>really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing<br/>to any body else."<br/><br/>"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"<br/>observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. "But you need not imagine Mr.<br/>Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John.<br/>Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of<br/>strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes<br/>enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more<br/>upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the<br/>power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours<br/>five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that<br/>home affords."<br/><br/>
