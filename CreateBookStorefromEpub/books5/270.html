<br/>"I mentioned no names, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a<br/>minister of state. I managed it extremely well."<br/><br/>Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on<br/>every possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in<br/>harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly<br/>addressed with,<br/><br/>"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here<br/>is charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the<br/>highest credit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)<br/>Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—<br/>Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!"— And<br/>when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,<br/>"We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have; not<br/>a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry<br/>shall have all the credit."<br/><br/>"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,"<br/>she shortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill. Very<br/>pleasant party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things<br/>did not seem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits<br/>of some.—So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken.<br/>However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.<br/>What say you both to our collecting the same party, and exploring<br/>to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?— It must be the<br/>same party, you know, quite the same party, not one exception."<br/><br/>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help<br/>being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself,<br/>resulting, she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and<br/>impatience to say every thing.<br/><br/>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is<br/>impossible to say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane's<br/>prospects— that is, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly<br/>recovered.— How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my<br/>power.— Such a happy little circle as you find us here.—Yes,<br/>indeed.— Charming young man!—that is—so very friendly; I mean good<br/>Mr. Perry!— such attention to Jane!"—And from her great, her more<br/>than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there,<br/>Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment<br/>towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously<br/>overcome.— After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a<br/>guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,<br/><br/>"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,<br/>that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but,<br/>the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised<br/>to join me here, and pay his respects to you."<br/><br/>"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—<br/>That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like<br/>morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."<br/><br/>"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from<br/>morning to night.—There is no end of people's coming to him, on<br/>some pretence or other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and<br/>churchwardens, are always wanting his opinion. They seem not able<br/>to do any thing without him.—`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say,<br/>`rather you than I.— I do not know what would become of my crayons<br/>and my instrument, if I had half so many applicants.'—Bad enough as<br/>it is, for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable<br/>degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.—However,<br/>he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you<br/>all." And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma—"A<br/>congratulatory visit, you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable."<br/><br/>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!—<br/><br/>
