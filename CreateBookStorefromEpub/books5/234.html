<br/>"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"<br/><br/>"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and<br/>though I thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she<br/>would not let him off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I,<br/>were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind<br/>friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable,<br/>though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.<br/>Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing—and I cannot say that any of<br/>them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. However, I shall always<br/>think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the<br/>kind friends who included me in it."<br/><br/>"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had<br/>been making up her mind the whole day?"<br/><br/>"I dare say she had."<br/><br/>"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all<br/>her friends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation<br/>that is possible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the<br/>family."<br/><br/>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every<br/>thing in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the<br/>Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery<br/>establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's<br/>acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!—A style of<br/>living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as to the children, except<br/>the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant<br/>sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with such regard and<br/>kindness!— It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.—And<br/>her salary!— I really cannot venture to name her salary to you,<br/>Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would<br/>hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like<br/>Jane."<br/><br/>"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what<br/>I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the<br/>amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such<br/>occasions, dearly earned."<br/><br/>"You are so noble in your ideas!"<br/><br/>"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"<br/><br/>"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a<br/>fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does<br/>not know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her<br/>thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any<br/>more."<br/><br/>
