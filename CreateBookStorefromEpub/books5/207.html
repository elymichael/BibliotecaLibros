<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet<br/>came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after<br/>sitting down and hesitating, thus began:<br/><br/>"Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I<br/>should like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you<br/>know, it will be over."<br/><br/>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There<br/>was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as<br/>much as her words, for something more than ordinary.<br/><br/>"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued, "to<br/>have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an<br/>altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you should<br/>have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than<br/>is necessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have<br/>done, and I dare say you understand me."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do."<br/><br/>"How I could so long a time be fancying myself!&#160;… " cried<br/>Harriet, warmly. "It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all<br/>extraordinary in him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or<br/>not—except that of the two I had rather not see him— and indeed I<br/>would go any distance round to avoid him—but I do not envy his wife<br/>in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her, as I have done:<br/>she is very charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think her<br/>very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall never forget her look<br/>the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish her<br/>no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together, it will not give<br/>me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I have been<br/>speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to have<br/>destroyed long ago—what I ought never to have kept— I know that<br/>very well (blushing as she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it<br/>all—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that<br/>you may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this<br/>parcel holds?" said she, with a conscious look.<br/><br/>
