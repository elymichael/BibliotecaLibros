<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the<br/>house from what she had brought out!—she had then been only daring<br/>to hope for a little respite of suffering;—she was now in an<br/>exquisite flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she<br/>believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed<br/>away.<br/><br/>They sat down to tea—the same party round the same table— how<br/>often it had been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on<br/>the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect<br/>of the western sun!—But never in such a state of spirits, never in<br/>any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon<br/>enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or<br/>even the attentive daughter.<br/><br/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against<br/>him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming,<br/>and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his<br/>ride.—Could he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little<br/>for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the<br/>impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing<br/>extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them<br/>very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr.<br/>Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally<br/>unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.<br/><br/>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever<br/>continued; but when he was gone, she began to be a little<br/>tranquillised and subdued—and in the course of the sleepless night,<br/>which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such<br/>very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her<br/>happiness must have some alloy. Her father—and Harriet. She could<br/>not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate<br/>claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the<br/>question. With respect to her father, it was a question soon<br/>answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a<br/>very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn<br/>resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the<br/>idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an<br/>engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the<br/>danger of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort<br/>to him.— How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult<br/>decision;— how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make<br/>her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?— On<br/>these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great— and<br/>her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach<br/>and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.— She could only<br/>resolve at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and<br/>communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be<br/>inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time<br/>from Highbury, and—indulging in one scheme more— nearly resolve,<br/>that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to<br/>Brunswick Square.—Isabella had been pleased with Harriet; and a few<br/>weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.— She did not<br/>think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty<br/>and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.— At any<br/>rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,<br/>from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an<br/>averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.<br/><br/>She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment<br/>which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,<br/>in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too<br/>soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground<br/>again with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to<br/>reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening<br/>before.<br/><br/>He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to<br/>have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when<br/>a letter was brought her from Randalls—a very thick letter;—she<br/>guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of<br/>reading it.— She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill;<br/>she wanted no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to<br/>herself— and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure<br/>she was incapable of it.—It must be waded through, however. She<br/>opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a note from Mrs. Weston to<br/>herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.<br/><br/>
