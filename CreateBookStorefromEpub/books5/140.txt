"Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play
quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you.
Every body last night said how well you played."

"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the
difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good
enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."

"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she
does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it
out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill
talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much
more than execution."

"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."

"Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she
had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—
There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play
so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,
because she will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night
whether she would get into any great family. How did you think the
Coxes looked?"

"Just as they always do—very vulgar."

"They told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly;" but
it is nothing of any consequence."

Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful
of its producing Mr. Elton.

"They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last
Saturday."

"Oh!"

"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to
stay to dinner."
