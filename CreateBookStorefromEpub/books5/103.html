The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss<br/>Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from<br/>the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and<br/>acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be<br/>unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be<br/>unfelt by the parents. They continued together with unabated regard<br/>however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,<br/>that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial<br/>affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what<br/>is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich<br/>and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was<br/>eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread<br/>to earn.<br/><br/>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing<br/>to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering<br/>on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her<br/>own judgment had fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that<br/>one-and-twenty should be the period. With the fortitude of a<br/>devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete<br/>the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of<br/>rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and<br/>mortification for ever.<br/><br/>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose<br/>such a resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they<br/>lived, no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers<br/>for ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her<br/>wholly; but this would be selfishness:—what must be at last, had<br/>better be soon. Perhaps they began to feel it might have been<br/>kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and<br/>spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as<br/>must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to<br/>catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched<br/>moment. She had never been quite well since the time of their<br/>daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered<br/>her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which,<br/>so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying<br/>spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to<br/>require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be<br/>discharged with tolerable comfort.<br/><br/>With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account<br/>to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some<br/>truths not told. It was her own choice to give the time of their<br/>absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect<br/>liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and<br/>the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether<br/>single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready<br/>sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent<br/>in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any<br/>thing else. Certain it was that she was to come; and that Highbury,<br/>instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long<br/>promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must put up for the present with<br/>Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years'<br/>absence.<br/><br/>Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did<br/>not like through three long months!—to be always doing more than<br/>she wished, and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane<br/>Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had<br/>once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished<br/>young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the<br/>accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments<br/>of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit<br/>her. But "she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know<br/>how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve— such apparent<br/>indifference whether she pleased or not—and then, her aunt was such<br/>an eternal talker!—and she was made such a fuss with by every<br/>body!—and it had been always imagined that they were to be so<br/>intimate—because their ages were the same, every body had supposed<br/>they must be so fond of each other." These were her reasons— she<br/>had no better.<br/><br/>It was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so<br/>magnified by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time<br/>after any considerable absence, without feeling that she had<br/>injured her; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival,<br/>after a two years' interval, she was particularly struck with the<br/>very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she<br/>had been depreciating. Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably<br/>elegant; and she had herself the highest value for elegance. Her<br/>height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall,<br/>and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly graceful;<br/>her size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a<br/>slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest<br/>evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her<br/>face—her features— there was more beauty in them altogether than<br/>she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing<br/>beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows,<br/>had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had<br/>been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and<br/>delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of<br/>beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such,<br/>she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance,<br/>which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.<br/>There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.<br/><br/>In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane<br/>Fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the<br/>sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she would<br/>dislike her no longer. When she took in her history, indeed, her<br/>situation, as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this<br/>elegance was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she<br/>was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but<br/>compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known<br/>particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly<br/>probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had<br/>so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be<br/>more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had<br/>resolved on. Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having<br/>seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing<br/>mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first. If it<br/>were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her side<br/>alone. She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,<br/>while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the<br/>best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this<br/>visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from<br/>him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious<br/>duty.<br/><br/>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable<br/>feelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that<br/>Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;<br/>nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.<br/><br/>These were charming feelings—but not lasting. Before she had<br/>committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship<br/>for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past<br/>prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, "She certainly<br/>is handsome; she is better than handsome!" Jane had spent an<br/>evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing<br/>was relapsing much into its usual state. Former provocations<br/>reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome,<br/>because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her<br/>powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how<br/>little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a<br/>slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new<br/>caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's<br/>offences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and<br/>the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an<br/>affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew<br/>off in higher style her own very superior performance. She was,<br/>besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There<br/>was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of<br/>politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was<br/>disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.<br/><br/>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more<br/>reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.<br/>She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's<br/>character, or her own value for his company, or opinion of the<br/>suitableness of the match. It was all general approbation and<br/>smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished. It did her no<br/>service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw its<br/>artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably was<br/>something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon,<br/>perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or<br/>been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve<br/>thousand pounds.<br/><br/>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that<br/>they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real<br/>information could Emma procure as to what he truly was. "Was he<br/>handsome?"—"She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man."<br/>"Was he agreeable?"— "He was generally thought so." "Did he appear<br/>a sensible young man; a young man of information?"—"At a<br/>watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was<br/>difficult to decide on such points. Manners were all that could be<br/>safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet<br/>had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his manners<br/>pleasing." Emma could not forgive her.<br/>
