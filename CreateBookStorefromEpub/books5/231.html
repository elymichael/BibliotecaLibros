<br/>"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in the<br/>world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous<br/>are most unfortunately blended in her."<br/><br/>"They are blended," said he, "I acknowledge; and, were she<br/>prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the<br/>ridiculous over the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would<br/>leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not<br/>quarrel with you for any liberties of manner. Were she your equal<br/>in situation— but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the<br/>case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to;<br/>and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation<br/>should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom<br/>she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a<br/>period when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in<br/>thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her,<br/>humble her—and before her niece, too—and before others, many of<br/>whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided by your treatment<br/>of her.—This is not pleasant to you, Emma—and it is very far from<br/>pleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I will tell you truths while I<br/>can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful<br/>counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me<br/>greater justice than you can do now."<br/><br/>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it<br/>was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.<br/>He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,<br/>and her tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against<br/>herself, mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to<br/>speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment<br/>overcome—then reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making<br/>no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out<br/>with voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too<br/>late. He had turned away, and the horses were in motion. She<br/>continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared<br/>unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing<br/>left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been<br/>expressed—almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt<br/>so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life.<br/>She was most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation<br/>there was no denying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have<br/>been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed<br/>herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And how suffer<br/>him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of<br/>concurrence, of common kindness!<br/><br/>Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but<br/>to feel it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was<br/>not necessary to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in<br/>spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma<br/>felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,<br/>without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they<br/>were.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
