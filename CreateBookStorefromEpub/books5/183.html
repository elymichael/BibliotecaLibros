Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—"Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."<br/><br/>"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley. "It is too small—<br/>wants strength. It is like a woman's writing."<br/><br/>This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him<br/>against the base aspersion. "No, it by no means wanted strength— it<br/>was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not<br/>Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?" No, she had heard<br/>from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put it<br/>away.<br/><br/>"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had my<br/>writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note<br/>of his.— Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write<br/>for you one day?"<br/><br/>"He chose to say he was employed"—<br/><br/>"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to<br/>convince Mr. Knightley."<br/><br/>"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill," said<br/>Mr. Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he<br/>will, of course, put forth his best."<br/><br/>Dinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,<br/>was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his<br/>request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was<br/>saying—<br/><br/>"Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the<br/>way."<br/><br/>Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped<br/>Emma. She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to<br/>know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She<br/>suspected that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely<br/>encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very<br/>dear, and that it had not been in vain. She thought there was an<br/>air of greater happiness than usual—a glow both of complexion and<br/>spirits.<br/><br/>She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and<br/>the expense of the Irish mails;—it was at her tongue's end— but she<br/>abstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should<br/>hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies<br/>out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly<br/>becoming to the beauty and grace of each.<br/>
