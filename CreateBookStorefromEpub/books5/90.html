<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.<br/>The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;<br/>and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter<br/>to stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole<br/>party set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of<br/>poor Isabella;—which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she<br/>doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always<br/>innocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine<br/>happiness.<br/><br/>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note<br/>from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,<br/>to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that he was proposing<br/>to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath; where,<br/>in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had<br/>engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the<br/>impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of weather<br/>and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose<br/>friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense— and had<br/>Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them."<br/><br/>Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr. Elton's absence just at<br/>this time was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for<br/>contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the<br/>manner in which it was announced. Resentment could not have been<br/>more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which<br/>she was so pointedly excluded. She had not even a share in his<br/>opening compliments.—Her name was not mentioned;— and there was so<br/>striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of<br/>leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as she thought, at<br/>first, could not escape her father's suspicion.<br/><br/>It did, however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize<br/>of so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never<br/>get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his<br/>language. It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with<br/>fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their<br/>lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was<br/>in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual<br/>promptitude.<br/><br/>She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had<br/>reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was<br/>desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting<br/>the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.<br/>She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to<br/>undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it<br/>was.— She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so<br/>industriously feeding—to appear in the ungracious character of the<br/>one preferred— and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and<br/>mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all her observations,<br/>all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last six weeks.<br/><br/>The confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight<br/>of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in<br/>charity with herself again.<br/><br/>
