She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was<br/>pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley<br/>keeping no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of<br/>health, activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion,<br/>to get about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as<br/>became the owner of Donwell Abbey. She had an opportunity now of<br/>speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped<br/>to hand her out.<br/><br/>"This is coming as you should do," said she; "like a gentleman.—<br/>I am quite glad to see you."<br/><br/>He thanked her, observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at<br/>the same moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I<br/>doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman<br/>than usual.— You might not have distinguished how I came, by my<br/>look or manner."<br/><br/>"Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of<br/>consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know<br/>to be beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare<br/>say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected<br/>unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those<br/>circumstances. Now you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid<br/>of being supposed ashamed. You are not striving to look taller than<br/>any body else. Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the<br/>same room with you."<br/><br/>"Nonsensical girl!" was his reply, but not at all in anger.<br/><br/>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the<br/>party as with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial<br/>respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence<br/>she could wish for. When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of<br/>love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband<br/>and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which<br/>marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him<br/>seated by her—and, as she firmly believed, not without some<br/>dexterity on his side.<br/><br/>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a<br/>proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the<br/>advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of<br/>Mr. Cox's family, the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females<br/>were to come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and<br/>Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any<br/>subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr.<br/>Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her<br/>attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote<br/>sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of<br/>Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that<br/>was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found it<br/>well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,<br/>received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been<br/>calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been<br/>struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking<br/>instrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and<br/>the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which<br/>ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side,<br/>and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had<br/>arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment<br/>of both aunt and niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss<br/>Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered<br/>to think who could possibly have ordered it— but now, they were<br/>both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;—of<br/>course it must be from Colonel Campbell.<br/><br/>"One can suppose nothing else," added Mrs. Cole, "and I was only<br/>surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it<br/>seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said<br/>about it. She knows their ways best; but I should not consider<br/>their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the<br/>present. They might chuse to surprize her."<br/><br/>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on<br/>the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel<br/>Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made;<br/>and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own<br/>way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole.<br/><br/>"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has<br/>given me more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane<br/>Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.<br/>It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses<br/>there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This<br/>is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but<br/>yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at<br/>our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know<br/>one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just<br/>beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is<br/>poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of<br/>the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in<br/>the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr. Cole but<br/>yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly<br/>fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the<br/>purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so<br/>obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and<br/>that really is the reason why the instrument was bought— or else I<br/>am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that<br/>Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening."<br/><br/>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that<br/>nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs.<br/>Cole's, turned to Frank Churchill.<br/>
