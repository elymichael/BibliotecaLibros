<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"Harriet, poor Harriet!"—Those were the words; in them lay the<br/>tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which<br/>constituted the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill<br/>had behaved very ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was<br/>not so much his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with<br/>him. It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's<br/>account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to<br/>be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr.<br/>Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, "Emma, you<br/>have been no friend to Harriet Smith."—She was afraid she had done<br/>her nothing but disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge<br/>herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and<br/>original author of the mischief; with having suggested such<br/>feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's<br/>imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and<br/>preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint<br/>on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged<br/>what she might have repressed. She might have prevented the<br/>indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence would<br/>have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought to<br/>have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her<br/>friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would<br/>have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself<br/>to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one<br/>against his ever caring for her.—"But, with common sense," she<br/>added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."<br/><br/>She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been<br/>angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.— As<br/>for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any<br/>present solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough;<br/>she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose<br/>ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally<br/>under cure.—Her days of insignificance and evil were over.—She<br/>would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.— Emma could now<br/>imagine why her own attentions had been slighted. This discovery<br/>laid many smaller matters open. No doubt it had been from<br/>jealousy.—In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might any<br/>thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed. An<br/>airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and<br/>arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She<br/>understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself<br/>from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she<br/>acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor<br/>happiness beyond her desert. But poor Harriet was such an<br/>engrossing charge! There was little sympathy to be spared for any<br/>body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment<br/>would be more severe than the first. Considering the very superior<br/>claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently<br/>stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and<br/>self-command, it would.— She must communicate the painful truth,<br/>however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had been<br/>among Mr. Weston's parting words. "For the present, the whole<br/>affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a<br/>point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very<br/>recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due<br/>decorum."— Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.<br/>It was her superior duty.<br/><br/>In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost<br/>ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and<br/>delicate office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just<br/>gone through by herself. The intelligence, which had been so<br/>anxiously announced to her, she was now to be anxiously announcing<br/>to another. Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and<br/>voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was<br/>approaching Randalls. Could the event of the disclosure bear an<br/>equal resemblance!— But of that, unfortunately, there could be no<br/>chance.<br/><br/>"Well, Miss Woodhouse!" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the<br/>room— "is not this the oddest news that ever was?"<br/><br/>"What news do you mean?" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look<br/>or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.<br/><br/>"About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange?<br/>Oh!—you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has<br/>told me himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a<br/>great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it<br/>to any body but you, but he said you knew it."<br/><br/>
