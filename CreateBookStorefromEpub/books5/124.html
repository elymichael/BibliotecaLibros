<br/>"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been<br/>children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we<br/>should be intimate,—that we should have taken to each other<br/>whenever she visited her friends. But we never did. I hardly know<br/>how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my<br/>side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and<br/>so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all<br/>their set. And then, her reserve—I never could attach myself to any<br/>one so completely reserved."<br/><br/>"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed," said he. "Oftentimes<br/>very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in<br/>reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person."<br/><br/>"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the<br/>attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a<br/>friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take<br/>the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.<br/>Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.<br/>I have no reason to think ill of her—not the least—except that such<br/>extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread<br/>of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest<br/>suspicions of there being something to conceal."<br/><br/>He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so<br/>long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well<br/>acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only<br/>their second meeting. He was not exactly what she had expected;<br/>less of the man of the world in some of his notions, less of the<br/>spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she had expected.<br/>His ideas seemed more moderate— his feelings warmer. She was<br/>particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton's house,<br/>which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and would<br/>not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not believe<br/>it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for<br/>having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could<br/>not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be<br/>ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a<br/>blockhead who wanted more.<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was<br/>talking about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever<br/>thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to<br/>its size, he could be no judge of the privations inevitably<br/>belonging to a small one. But Emma, in her own mind, determined<br/>that he did know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a<br/>very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry,<br/>from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the inroads on<br/>domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad<br/>butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe<br/>could not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he<br/>would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early<br/>establishment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
