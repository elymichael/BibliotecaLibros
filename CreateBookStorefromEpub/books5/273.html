"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.<br/>Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been<br/>tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more<br/>openly than might have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should<br/>certainly have been impertinent."<br/><br/>"Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma<br/>thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of<br/>all her usual composure—"there would have been no danger. The<br/>danger would have been of my wearying you. You could not have<br/>gratified me more than by expressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss<br/>Woodhouse, (speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness<br/>which I have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is<br/>particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends,<br/>whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to<br/>such a degree as to—I have not time for half that I could wish to<br/>say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for<br/>myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately—in short, if your<br/>compassion does not stand my friend—"<br/><br/>"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly,<br/>and taking her hand. "You owe me no apologies; and every body to<br/>whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,<br/>so delighted even—"<br/><br/>"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.— So<br/>cold and artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of<br/>deceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you."<br/><br/>"Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my<br/>side. Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to<br/>be done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.<br/>I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"<br/><br/>"Very."<br/><br/>"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—<br/>just as I begin to know you."<br/><br/>"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I<br/>am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."<br/><br/>"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma,<br/>smiling—"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."<br/><br/>The smile was returned as Jane answered,<br/><br/>"You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to<br/>you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with<br/>Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three<br/>months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over, I<br/>imagine there will be nothing more to wait for."<br/>
