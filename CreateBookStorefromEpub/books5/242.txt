"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling
voice. "Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what
you are to hear?"

"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do
guess."

"You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you
directly;" (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking
up.) "He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary
errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak
to his father on a subject,—to announce an attachment—"

She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then
of Harriet.

"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "an
engagement— a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what
will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss
Fairfax are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!"

Emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck,
exclaimed,

"Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean
it?"

"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting
her eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time
to recover— "You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has
been a solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at
Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing
it but themselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—
It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it
is yet almost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.— I
thought I knew him."

Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between
two ideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;
and poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and
require confirmation, repeated confirmation.

"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is a
circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I
can at all comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—
before either of them came to Highbury?"

"Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma,
very much. It has hurt his father equally. Some part of his conduct
we cannot excuse."
