<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous<br/>as herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough<br/>by letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!<br/><br/>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,<br/>without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma<br/>fancied there was a something of resentment, a something bordering<br/>on it in her style, which increased the desirableness of their<br/>being separate.— It might be only her own consciousness; but it<br/>seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment<br/>under such a stroke.<br/><br/>She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and<br/>she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,<br/>without resorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss. Harriet<br/>really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs.<br/>John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health<br/>was a recommendation to her—and though not so fond of a dentist as<br/>of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her<br/>care.—When it was thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed<br/>it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.— Harriet was to<br/>go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be<br/>conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.—It was all arranged, it was<br/>all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.<br/><br/>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she<br/>could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by<br/>that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which<br/>had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near<br/>her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be<br/>enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.<br/><br/>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made<br/>perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she<br/>could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and<br/>employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out<br/>of herself.<br/><br/>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the<br/>place in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a<br/>communication before her, one which she only could be competent to<br/>make— the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would<br/>have nothing to do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer<br/>the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional<br/>agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved—<br/>and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the<br/>appointed time.—A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of<br/>mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be<br/>hers.<br/><br/>
