<br/>"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother<br/>is perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable<br/>as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she<br/>would probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a<br/>good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little<br/>money, it might be very desirable."<br/><br/>"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years<br/>old!"<br/><br/>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who<br/>are not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his<br/>fortune entirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the<br/>world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died,<br/>whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all<br/>afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with<br/>diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to<br/>impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."<br/><br/>"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have<br/>no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs.<br/>Martin talks of taking a boy another year."<br/><br/>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does<br/>marry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his<br/>sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether<br/>objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all<br/>fit for you to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make<br/>you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be no<br/>doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support<br/>your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or<br/>there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading<br/>you."<br/><br/>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at<br/>Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not<br/>afraid of what any body can do."<br/><br/>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but<br/>I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be<br/>independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you<br/>permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to<br/>have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that<br/>if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I<br/>wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to<br/>be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere<br/>farmer's daughter, without education."<br/><br/>"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry<br/>any body but what had had some education—and been very well brought<br/>up. However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's—and<br/>I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I<br/>shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially<br/>Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are<br/>quite as well educated as me. But if he marries a very ignorant,<br/>vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help<br/>it."<br/><br/>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and<br/>saw no alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first<br/>admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there<br/>would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any<br/>friendly arrangement of her own.<br/><br/>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on<br/>the Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very<br/>respectfully at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her<br/>companion. Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of<br/>survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked<br/>together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr.<br/>Robert Martin. His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a<br/>sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when<br/>he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose<br/>all the ground he had gained in Harriet's inclination. Harriet was<br/>not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's<br/>gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as<br/>if he did not know what manner was.<br/><br/>
