"I should not have thought it possible," she began, "that you
could have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—
but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I
should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to
mean any other person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know
who would ever look at him in the company of the other. I hope I
have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is
like nobody by his side. And that you should have been so mistaken,
is amazing!—I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved
and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have
considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to
think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful
things had happened; that there had been matches of greater
disparity (those were your very words);— I should not have dared to
give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if you, who
had been always acquainted with him—"

"Harriet!" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely—"Let us
understand each other now, without the possibility of farther
mistake. Are you speaking of—Mr. Knightley?"

"To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—
and so I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as
clear as possible."

"Not quite," returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that
you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I
could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. I am
sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in
protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."

"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"

"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I
said on the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your
attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it
was extremely natural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself
very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even
what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your
rescue.—The impression of it is strong on my memory."

"Oh, dear," cried Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I
was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not
the gipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with
some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious
circumstance— of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance,
when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no
other partner in the room. That was the kind action; that was the
noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made
me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon
earth."

"Good God!" cried Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate— most
deplorable mistake!—What is to be done?"

"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood
me? At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have
been, if the other had been the person; and now—it is
possible—"

She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.
