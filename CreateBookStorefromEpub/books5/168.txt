The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "My
brother Mr. Suckling's seat;"—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple
Grove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty;
and the house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most
favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all
that she could see or imagine. "Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She
was quite struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and
size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite
room."— Mr. Elton was appealed to.—"Was not it astonishingly like?—
She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."

"And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very
like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the
house. I really could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss
Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I
am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many
happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming
place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;
but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted,
like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it
is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. I
always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."

Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully
sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking
herself.

"So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—
the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are
strikingly like. The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same
profusion as here, and stand very much in the same way—just across
the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench
round it, which put me so exactly in mind! My brother and sister
will be enchanted with this place. People who have extensive
grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same
style."

Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea
that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little
for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth
while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in
reply,

"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will
think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties."

"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England,
you know. Surry is the garden of England."

"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many
counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as
Surry."

"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied
smile." I never heard any county but Surry called so."

Emma was silenced.
