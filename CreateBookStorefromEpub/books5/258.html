<br/>He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he<br/>would not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled<br/>to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to<br/>lower herself in his opinion. She went on, however.<br/><br/>"I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by<br/>his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.— An old<br/>story, probably—a common case—and no more than has happened to<br/>hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable<br/>in one who sets up as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances<br/>assisted the temptation. He was the son of Mr. Weston—he was<br/>continually here—I always found him very pleasant—and, in short,<br/>for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,<br/>they all centre in this at last—my vanity was flattered, and I<br/>allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some time, indeed— I<br/>have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought them a<br/>habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side. He<br/>has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been<br/>attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.<br/>He never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his<br/>real situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about<br/>him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than<br/>myself—except that I was not blinded—that it was my good<br/>fortune—that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."<br/><br/>She had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her<br/>conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far<br/>as she could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his<br/>usual tone, he said,<br/><br/>"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can<br/>suppose, however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance<br/>with him has been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated<br/>him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a<br/>chance.—I have no motive for wishing him ill—and for her sake,<br/>whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,<br/>I shall certainly wish him well."<br/><br/>"I have no doubt of their being happy together," said Emma; "I<br/>believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."<br/><br/>"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with<br/>energy. "So early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a<br/>man chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to<br/>have drawn such a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all<br/>human calculation, has before him!—Assured of the love of such a<br/>woman—the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches<br/>for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,— equality of<br/>situation—I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and<br/>manners that are important; equality in every point but one— and<br/>that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such<br/>as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the<br/>only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman<br/>a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,<br/>where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the<br/>happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of<br/>fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young<br/>woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary<br/>her by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought<br/>round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have<br/>found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has<br/>only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.— He<br/>had used every body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—<br/>He is a fortunate man indeed!"<br/><br/>"You speak as if you envied him."<br/><br/>"And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my<br/>envy."<br/><br/>Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence<br/>of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if<br/>possible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally<br/>different—the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for<br/>breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,<br/><br/>"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are<br/>determined, I see, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but I cannot<br/>be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may<br/>wish it unsaid the next moment."<br/><br/>
