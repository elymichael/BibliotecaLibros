"Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which
pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."

"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which we
do not think alike." He paused a moment, again smiling, with his
eyes fixed on her face. "Does nothing occur to you?— Do not you
recollect?—Harriet Smith."

Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of
something, though she knew not what.

"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he. "You
have, I believe, and know the whole."

"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."

"You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is.
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."

Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared— and
her eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!" but her
lips were closed.

"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from
Robert Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago."

She was still looking at him with the most speaking
amazement.

"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our
opinions were the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be
sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in
the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject."

"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exerting
herself. "It is not that such a circumstance would now make me
unhappy, but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You
cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again—yet. You
only mean, that he intends it."
