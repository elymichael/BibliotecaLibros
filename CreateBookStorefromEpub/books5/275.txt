Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if
the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it
was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been
decided in wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge
that it was with any view of making a match for her, hereafter,
with either of Isabella's sons; but she was convinced that a
daughter would suit both father and mother best. It would be a
great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older— and even Mr. Weston
might be growing older ten years hence—to have his fireside
enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the
fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston— no
one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would
be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should
not have their powers in exercise again.

"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me," she
continued—"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in
Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her
own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."

"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even
more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at
all. It will be the only difference."

"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of
her?"

"Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be
disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I
am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest
Emma. I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be
horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"

Emma laughed, and replied: "But I had the assistance of all your
endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt
whether my own sense would have corrected me without it."
