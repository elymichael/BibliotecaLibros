"Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to<br/>herself through a great part of this speech, "how do you know that<br/>Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday?"<br/><br/>"Certainly," replied he, surprized, "I do not absolutely know<br/>it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what<br/>you have told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was<br/>refused."<br/><br/>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and<br/>Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as<br/>he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,<br/><br/>"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What<br/>is the foolish girl about?"<br/><br/>"Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible to<br/>a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man<br/>always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."<br/><br/>"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is<br/>the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,<br/>if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken."<br/><br/>"I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer."<br/><br/>"You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is<br/>your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him."<br/><br/>"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should<br/>not feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable<br/>young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am<br/>rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address<br/>her. By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. It is<br/>a pity that they were ever got over."<br/><br/>"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and<br/>warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards,<br/>"No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in<br/>sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl<br/>blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth,<br/>nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin?<br/>She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no<br/>settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations.<br/>She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not<br/>a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught<br/>nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired<br/>any thing herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with<br/>her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail<br/>her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My<br/>only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being<br/>beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as<br/>to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as<br/>to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.<br/>But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to<br/>trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of<br/>disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led<br/>aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to<br/>be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)<br/>that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.<br/>Even your satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind<br/>immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving<br/>Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember<br/>saying to myself, `Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet,<br/>will think this a good match.'"<br/>
