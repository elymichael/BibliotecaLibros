<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,<br/>a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured<br/>of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept<br/>another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had<br/>to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few<br/>days brought the party from London, and she had no sooner an<br/>opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet, than she became<br/>perfectly satisfied—unaccountable as it was!— that Robert Martin<br/>had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and was now forming all<br/>her views of happiness.<br/><br/>Harriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at<br/>first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and<br/>silly, and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to<br/>die away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,<br/>and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as<br/>to her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear<br/>of that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified<br/>congratulations.— Harriet was most happy to give every particular<br/>of the evening at Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could<br/>dwell on it all with the utmost delight. But what did such<br/>particulars explain?— The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge,<br/>that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his<br/>continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this, it must<br/>ever be unintelligible to Emma.<br/><br/>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving<br/>her fresh reason for thinking so.—Harriet's parentage became known.<br/>She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford<br/>her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and<br/>decent enough to have always wished for concealment.—Such was the<br/>blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch<br/>for!— It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of<br/>many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for<br/>Mr. Knightley—or for the Churchills—or even for Mr. Elton!— The<br/>stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have<br/>been a stain indeed.<br/><br/>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was<br/>treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became<br/>acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,<br/>she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth<br/>which could bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of<br/>Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and<br/>in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more, of<br/>security, stability, and improvement. She would be placed in the<br/>midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than<br/>herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for<br/>cheerfulness. She would be never led into temptation, nor left for<br/>it to find her out. She would be respectable and happy; and Emma<br/>admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have<br/>created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;—or,<br/>if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.<br/><br/>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the<br/>Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be<br/>regretted.— The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their<br/>friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and,<br/>fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already<br/>beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.<br/><br/>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church,<br/>and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a<br/>satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as<br/>he stood before them, could impair.—Perhaps, indeed, at that time<br/>she scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at<br/>the altar might next fall on herself.—Robert Martin and Harriet<br/>Smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be<br/>married.<br/><br/>
