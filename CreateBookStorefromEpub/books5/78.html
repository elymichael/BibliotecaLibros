<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as<br/>they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose<br/>his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour.<br/>Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them<br/>for the place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew<br/>herself just as happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to<br/>be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there<br/>was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such<br/>unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with<br/>such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being<br/>always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,<br/>arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and<br/>herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston<br/>had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted<br/>communication of all those little matters on which the daily<br/>happiness of private life depends, was one of the first<br/>gratifications of each.<br/><br/>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might<br/>not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present<br/>half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch,<br/>her voice was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as<br/>little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else<br/>unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.<br/><br/>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone<br/>through before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated<br/>long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of<br/>his own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and<br/>had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James<br/>should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and<br/>Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions<br/>to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.<br/><br/>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her<br/>rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he<br/>was close to her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange<br/>insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat<br/>at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance<br/>on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.<br/>Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could<br/>not avoid the internal suggestion of "Can it really be as my<br/>brother imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning<br/>to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?—Absurd and<br/>insufferable!"— Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly<br/>warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted<br/>with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings<br/>with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a<br/>would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her<br/>good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for<br/>Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was<br/>even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as<br/>something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering<br/>period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to<br/>listen to. She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some<br/>information about his son; she heard the words "my son," and<br/>"Frank," and "my son," repeated several times over; and, from a few<br/>other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an<br/>early visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the<br/>subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her<br/>would have been awkward.<br/><br/>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never<br/>marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently<br/>thought—especially since his father's marriage with Miss<br/>Taylor—that if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit<br/>her in age, character and condition. He seemed by this connexion<br/>between the families, quite to belong to her. She could not but<br/>suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think<br/>of. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was very strongly<br/>persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any<br/>body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete<br/>with good than any she could change it for, she had a great<br/>curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,<br/>of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure<br/>in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'<br/>imaginations.<br/><br/>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully<br/>ill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while<br/>feeling very cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could<br/>not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information<br/>again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So<br/>it proved;— for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by<br/>Mr. Weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in<br/>the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of<br/>mutton, to say to her,<br/><br/>
