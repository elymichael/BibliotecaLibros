But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance<br/>proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while<br/>their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his<br/>mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so<br/>much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she<br/>secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as<br/>was an additional proof of his knowing how to please— and of his<br/>certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not<br/>advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly<br/>deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little<br/>of the matter. He understood what would be welcome; he could be<br/>sure of little else. "His father's marriage," he said, "had been<br/>the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family<br/>from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered<br/>as having conferred the highest obligation on him."<br/><br/>He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's<br/>merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course<br/>of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed<br/>Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And<br/>at last, as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for<br/>travelling round to its object, he wound it all up with<br/>astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.<br/><br/>"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for," said he; "but<br/>I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more<br/>than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did<br/>not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs.<br/>Weston."<br/><br/>"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my<br/>feelings," said Emma; "were you to guess her to be eighteen, I<br/>should listen with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with<br/>you for using such words. Don't let her imagine that you have<br/>spoken of her as a pretty young woman."<br/><br/>"I hope I should know better," he replied; "no, depend upon it,<br/>(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should<br/>understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought<br/>extravagant in my terms."<br/><br/>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be<br/>expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong<br/>possession of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his<br/>compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or<br/>proofs of defiance. She must see more of him to understand his<br/>ways; at present she only felt they were agreeable.<br/><br/>She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.<br/>His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them<br/>with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined<br/>not to look, she was confident that he was often listening.<br/><br/>Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,<br/>the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or<br/>suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not<br/>farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.— Though<br/>always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, he never<br/>suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if<br/>he could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to<br/>suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them. She<br/>blessed the favouring blindness. He could now, without the drawback<br/>of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any<br/>possible treachery in his guest, give way to all his natural<br/>kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils of<br/>sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed<br/>anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which,<br/>however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself<br/>till after another night.<br/><br/>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.—"He must be<br/>going. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many<br/>errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body<br/>else." His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately<br/>also, saying,<br/><br/>"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the<br/>opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or<br/>other, and therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of<br/>being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a<br/>lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.<br/>I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though<br/>Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name—I should rather say<br/>Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?"<br/><br/>"To be sure we do," cried his father; "Mrs. Bates—we passed her<br/>house— I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are<br/>acquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth,<br/>and a fine girl she is. Call upon her, by all means."<br/>
