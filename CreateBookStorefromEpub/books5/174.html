`And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'<br/><br/>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane<br/>Fairfax."<br/><br/>"I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm<br/>answer— "and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's<br/>situation and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and<br/>Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can<br/>be unknown."<br/><br/>"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,<br/>such obscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have<br/>enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think<br/>she feels it. I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One<br/>can see that she feels the want of encouragement. I like her the<br/>better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a<br/>great advocate for timidity—and I am sure one does not often meet<br/>with it.—But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely<br/>prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful<br/>character, and interests me more than I can express."<br/><br/>"You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or<br/>any of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have<br/>known her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention<br/>than"—<br/><br/>"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who<br/>dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If we set the example,<br/>many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our<br/>situations. We have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and we<br/>live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax,<br/>at any time, the least inconvenient.—I should be extremely<br/>displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could<br/>make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of<br/>it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I<br/>should, considering what I have been used to. My greatest danger,<br/>perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too<br/>much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably<br/>be my model more than it ought to be— for we do not at all affect<br/>to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my<br/>resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.— I shall certainly<br/>have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I<br/>can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall<br/>be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My<br/>acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of<br/>hearing of something to suit her shortly.—I shall introduce her, of<br/>course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come<br/>to us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets a<br/>little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,<br/>for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is<br/>highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while they<br/>are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her<br/>in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."<br/><br/>"Poor Jane Fairfax!"—thought Emma.—"You have not deserved this.<br/>You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a<br/>punishment beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and<br/>protection of Mrs. Elton!—`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens!<br/>Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!—<br/>But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of<br/>that woman's tongue!"<br/><br/>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so<br/>exclusively addressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a<br/>"dear Miss Woodhouse." The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon<br/>afterwards appeared, and she was left in peace—neither forced to be<br/>the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's<br/>guidance, the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only<br/>sharing with others in a general way, in knowing what was felt,<br/>what was meditated, what was done.<br/><br/>She looked on with some amusement.—Miss Bates's gratitude for<br/>Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless<br/>simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies— the most<br/>amiable, affable, delightful woman—just as accomplished and<br/>condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only<br/>surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and<br/>tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking<br/>with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the<br/>Eltons! This was astonishing!—She could not have believed it<br/>possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure<br/>such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.<br/><br/>"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.—"To chuse to remain<br/>here month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to<br/>chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of<br/>her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who<br/>have always loved her with such real, generous affection."<br/><br/>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the<br/>Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the<br/>Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till<br/>Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them<br/>there. According to Miss Bates—it all came from her—Mrs. Dixon had<br/>written most pressingly. Would Jane but go, means were to be found,<br/>servants sent, friends contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed<br/>to exist; but still she had declined it!<br/>
