"That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good<br/>friend. Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you<br/>have the warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough<br/>humourist.— Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your<br/>attention to me in the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the<br/>very thing to please me."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the<br/>shade. He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to<br/>join the party; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down<br/>out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse<br/>must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an<br/>hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.<br/><br/>He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid<br/>him for his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at<br/>Donwell for two years. "Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and<br/>Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with Mrs.<br/>Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens. He did not<br/>suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should<br/>like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very<br/>happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his<br/>neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all to his, and<br/>Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He<br/>thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them— very<br/>kind and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of<br/>dining out."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready<br/>concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that<br/>it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme<br/>as a particular compliment to themselves.—Emma and Harriet<br/>professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr.<br/>Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if<br/>possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have<br/>been dispensed with.— Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he<br/>should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time<br/>in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the<br/>party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last<br/>Donwell was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,—the<br/>weather appearing exactly right.<br/><br/>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse<br/>was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to<br/>partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable<br/>rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the<br/>morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk<br/>with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to<br/>come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.— Mrs. Weston, who<br/>seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the<br/>time with him, remained, when all the others were invited or<br/>persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.<br/><br/>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as<br/>she was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave<br/>him, and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory<br/>with more particular observation, more exact understanding of a<br/>house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all<br/>her family.<br/><br/>She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance<br/>with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she<br/>viewed the respectable size and style of the building, its<br/>suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered—<br/>its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of<br/>which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely<br/>a sight—and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which<br/>neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.—The house was<br/>larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal<br/>of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable, and one<br/>or two handsome rooms.—It was just what it ought to be, and it<br/>looked what it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect for it, as<br/>the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted in<br/>blood and understanding.—Some faults of temper John Knightley had;<br/>but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given<br/>them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush.<br/>These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged<br/>them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect<br/>round the strawberry-beds.—The whole party were assembled,<br/>excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from<br/>Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her<br/>large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in<br/>gathering, accepting, or talking—strawberries, and only<br/>strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.—"The best fruit in<br/>England— every body's favourite—always wholesome.—These the finest<br/>beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather for one's self—the only<br/>way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly the best time—never<br/>tired— every sort good—hautboy infinitely superior—no comparison—<br/>the others hardly eatable—hautboys very scarce—Chili preferred—<br/>white wood finest flavour of all—price of strawberries in London—<br/>abundance about Bristol—Maple Grove—cultivation—beds when to be<br/>renewed—gardeners thinking exactly different—no general rule—<br/>gardeners never to be put out of their way—delicious fruit— only<br/>too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to cherries— currants more<br/>refreshing—only objection to gathering strawberries the<br/>stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no longer— must<br/>go and sit in the shade."<br/><br/>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only<br/>once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her<br/>son-in-law, to inquire if he were come—and she was a little<br/>uneasy.— She had some fears of his horse.<br/><br/>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was<br/>obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking<br/>of.— A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs.<br/>Elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.<br/>It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in<br/>felicity and splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a<br/>cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady<br/>known at Maple Grove. Delightful, charming, superior, first<br/>circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing—and Mrs. Elton was wild<br/>to have the offer closed with immediately.—On her side, all was<br/>warmth, energy, and triumph—and she positively refused to take her<br/>friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that<br/>she would not at present engage in any thing, repeating the same<br/>motives which she had been heard to urge before.— Still Mrs. Elton<br/>insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the<br/>morrow's post.—How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to<br/>Emma.—She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly—and at last, with<br/>a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.— "Should<br/>not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens— all<br/>the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent."—The pertinacity<br/>of her friend seemed more than she could bear.<br/><br/>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a<br/>scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they<br/>insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad<br/>short avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an<br/>equal distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure<br/>grounds.— It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a<br/>low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their<br/>erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which<br/>never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be the taste of<br/>such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view<br/>which closed it extremely pretty.—The considerable slope, at nearly<br/>the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper<br/>form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of<br/>considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;— and<br/>at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose<br/>the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a<br/>close and handsome curve around it.<br/>
