"Yes, oh! yes"—he replied; "I was just going to mention it. A<br/>very successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very<br/>much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt<br/>had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.<br/>As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable<br/>visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps<br/>all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be<br/>at home before him—but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to<br/>my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)<br/>joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them<br/>very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had not given<br/>me the possibility of escape before."<br/><br/>"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"<br/><br/>"Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to<br/>look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is<br/>it? Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is<br/>naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill<br/>health.— A most deplorable want of complexion."<br/><br/>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss<br/>Fairfax's complexion. "It was certainly never brilliant, but she<br/>would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a<br/>softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to<br/>the character of her face." He listened with all due deference;<br/>acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same—but yet he<br/>must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want of<br/>the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a fine<br/>complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the<br/>effect was—fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the<br/>effect was.<br/><br/>"Well," said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste.—At least<br/>you admire her except her complexion."<br/><br/>He shook his head and laughed.—"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax<br/>and her complexion."<br/><br/>"Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same<br/>society?"<br/><br/>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily<br/>exclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends<br/>every day of their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to<br/>Highbury himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has<br/>always business at Ford's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray<br/>let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be<br/>a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at Ford's. It will<br/>be taking out my freedom.— I dare say they sell gloves."<br/><br/>"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism.<br/>You will be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you<br/>came, because you were Mr. Weston's son—but lay out half a guinea<br/>at Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own<br/>virtues."<br/><br/>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of "Men's<br/>Beavers" and "York Tan" were bringing down and displaying on the<br/>counter, he said—"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were<br/>speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of<br/>this burst of my amor patriae. Do not let me lose it. I assure you<br/>the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the<br/>loss of any happiness in private life."<br/><br/>"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and<br/>her party at Weymouth."<br/>
