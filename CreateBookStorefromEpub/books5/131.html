"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"<br/><br/>"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.<br/>She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument<br/>would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is<br/>more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs.<br/>Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide<br/>mine."<br/><br/>"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon<br/>in them."<br/><br/>"Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must<br/>be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the<br/>other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her<br/>performance."<br/><br/>"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which<br/>I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good<br/>intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help<br/>suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,<br/>he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became<br/>conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess<br/>twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure<br/>there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to<br/>Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she<br/>must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would<br/>have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her native<br/>air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer it might have<br/>passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the<br/>months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages<br/>would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health,<br/>and I dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my<br/>suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but<br/>I honestly tell you what they are."<br/><br/>"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr.<br/>Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for<br/>being very decided."<br/><br/>"And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?— A<br/>water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He<br/>caught her."<br/><br/>"He did. I was there—one of the party."<br/><br/>"Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for<br/>it seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I<br/>should have made some discoveries."<br/><br/>"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the<br/>fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that<br/>Mr. Dixon caught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the<br/>consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more<br/>durable—indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were<br/>comfortable again— yet that was too general a sensation for any<br/>thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say,<br/>however, that you might not have made discoveries."<br/><br/>The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to<br/>share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the<br/>courses, and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others;<br/>but when the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish<br/>was placed exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally<br/>restored, Emma said,<br/>
