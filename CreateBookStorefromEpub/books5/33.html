"Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed<br/>me never to come to Hartfield any more!"<br/><br/>"Dear affectionate creature!—You banished to Abbey-Mill<br/>Farm!—You confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all<br/>your life! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to<br/>ask it. He must have a pretty good opinion of himself."<br/><br/>"I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said<br/>Harriet, her conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is<br/>very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and<br/>have a great regard for—but that is quite a different thing<br/>from—and you know, though he may like me, it does not follow that I<br/>should—and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I<br/>have seen people—and if one comes to compare them, person and<br/>manners, there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and<br/>agreeable. However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable<br/>young man, and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much<br/>attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as to leaving you,<br/>it is what I would not do upon any consideration."<br/><br/>"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not<br/>be parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is<br/>asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable<br/>letter."<br/><br/>"Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too."<br/><br/>Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a<br/>"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the<br/>clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,<br/>to know that her husband could write a good letter."<br/><br/>"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be<br/>always happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to<br/>refuse him. But how shall I do? What shall I say?"<br/><br/>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and<br/>advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the<br/>hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest<br/>against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the<br/>formation of every sentence. The looking over his letter again, in<br/>replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was<br/>particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive<br/>expressions; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of<br/>making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother and<br/>sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should<br/>not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had<br/>come in her way at that moment, he would have been accepted after<br/>all.<br/><br/>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The<br/>business was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the<br/>evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and<br/>sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes<br/>by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.<br/><br/>"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in<br/>rather a sorrowful tone.<br/><br/>"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my<br/>Harriet. You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be<br/>spared to Abbey-Mill."<br/>
