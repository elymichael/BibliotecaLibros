"Well, there is feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered in<br/>finding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond<br/>of her. `Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long<br/>continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a<br/>very liberal thanker, with his thousands and tens of<br/>thousands.—`Happier than I deserve.' Come, he knows himself there.<br/>`Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune.'—Those were<br/>Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?— And a fine ending—and there is<br/>the letter. The child of good fortune! That was your name for him,<br/>was it?"<br/><br/>"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;<br/>but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of<br/>him for it. I hope it does him some service with you."<br/><br/>"Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of<br/>inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his<br/>opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but<br/>still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,<br/>and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being<br/>constantly with her, I am very ready to believe his character will<br/>improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of<br/>principle that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of something<br/>else. I have another person's interest at present so much at heart,<br/>that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I<br/>left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one<br/>subject."<br/><br/>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike<br/>English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in<br/>love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without<br/>attacking the happiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at<br/>the first word. "While her dear father lived, any change of<br/>condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit him."<br/>Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility<br/>of her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as<br/>herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he could not<br/>agree to. He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently;<br/>he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to<br/>Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge of<br/>Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and now<br/>he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a<br/>risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must<br/>not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt<br/>that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on<br/>the sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find<br/>in any respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at<br/>Hartfield; that so long as her father's happiness in other words<br/>his life—required Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his<br/>likewise.<br/><br/>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own<br/>passing thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected<br/>it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She<br/>was sensible of all the affection it evinced. She felt that, in<br/>quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of<br/>independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with<br/>her father, and in no house of his own, there would be much, very<br/>much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it, and advised<br/>him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no<br/>reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He<br/>had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm<br/>consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the<br/>whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.<br/><br/>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma. "I am<br/>sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent<br/>before you ask mine."<br/><br/>She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly<br/>promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding<br/>it a very good scheme.<br/><br/>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of<br/>view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was<br/>never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose<br/>rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.<br/>Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;<br/>and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and<br/>found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike<br/>of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which<br/>at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the<br/>sister and the aunt.<br/><br/>This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at<br/>Hartfield— the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it<br/>became. His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,<br/>their mutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for<br/>herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—<br/>Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be<br/>giving increase of melancholy!<br/><br/>She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every<br/>blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of<br/>her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The<br/>delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor<br/>Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance<br/>from. She would be a loser in every way. Emma could not deplore her<br/>future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment. In such a<br/>party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but<br/>for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity<br/>that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited<br/>punishment.<br/><br/>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,<br/>supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.<br/>Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—<br/>not like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so<br/>truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less<br/>worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of<br/>Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men in one<br/>year.<br/>
