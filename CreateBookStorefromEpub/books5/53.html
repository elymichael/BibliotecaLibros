<br/>Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.<br/><br/>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near<br/>being christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall<br/>have her here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall<br/>put her—and what room there will be for the children?"<br/><br/>"Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she<br/>always has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as<br/>usual, you know. Why should there be any change?"<br/><br/>"I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was<br/>here!—not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John<br/>Knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she<br/>is sadly taken away from us all!—and how sorry she will be when she<br/>comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!"<br/><br/>"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."<br/><br/>"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized<br/>when I first heard she was going to be married."<br/><br/>"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella<br/>is here."<br/><br/>"Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed<br/>tone)—she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for<br/>any thing."<br/><br/>"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a<br/>case of necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the<br/>28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the<br/>whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three<br/>days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises<br/>to give up his claim this Christmas—though you know it is longer<br/>since they were with him, than with us."<br/><br/>"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were<br/>to be anywhere but at Hartfield."<br/><br/>
