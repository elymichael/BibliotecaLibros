Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,

And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,

May its approval beam in that soft eye!

She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it
through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines,
and then passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to
herself, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the
confusion of hope and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well
indeed. I have read worse charades. Courtship—a very good hint. I
give you credit for it. This is feeling your way. This is saying
very plainly—`Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses
to you. Approve my charade and my intentions in the same
glance.'

May its approval beam in that soft eye!

Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all
epithets, the justest that could be given.

Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.

Humph—Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very
much in love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish
you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For
once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An
excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must
come to a crisis soon now.

She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant
observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great
length, by the eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.

"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an
idea—I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do
try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any
thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who
could be the young lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be
woman?
