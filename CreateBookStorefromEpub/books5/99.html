"Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing— Mrs.<br/>Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was— Mrs.<br/>Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for<br/>as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so<br/>very great a favourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole<br/>does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I must say that<br/>Jane deserves it as much as any body can. And so she began<br/>inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you cannot have heard<br/>from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' and when<br/>I immediately said, `But indeed we have, we had a letter this very<br/>morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized.<br/>`Have you, upon your honour?' said she; `well, that is quite<br/>unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'"<br/><br/>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling<br/>interest—<br/><br/>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely<br/>happy. I hope she is well?"<br/><br/>"Thank you. You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt,<br/>while eagerly hunting for the letter.—"Oh! here it is. I was sure<br/>it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,<br/>without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my<br/>hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.<br/>I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was<br/>reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her— a<br/>letter from Jane—that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew<br/>it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my<br/>huswife—and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she<br/>says;—but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,<br/>apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two pages you see—<br/>hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses<br/>half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She<br/>often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty, now I<br/>think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'—<br/>don't you, ma'am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive<br/>to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her— every<br/>word of it—I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out<br/>every word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so good as<br/>they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with the<br/>help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother's are really<br/>very good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, `I am sure,<br/>grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do—and<br/>so much fine work as you have done too!—I only wish my eyes may<br/>last me as well.'"<br/><br/>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for<br/>breath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of<br/>Miss Fairfax's handwriting.<br/><br/>"You are extremely kind," replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;<br/>"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am<br/>sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure<br/>as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf<br/>you know. Ma'am," addressing her, "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse<br/>is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?"<br/><br/>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment<br/>repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.<br/>She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without<br/>seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter,<br/>and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight<br/>excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her<br/>attention.<br/><br/>"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at<br/>all. By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three<br/>times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.<br/>But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better<br/>than she does me. Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not<br/>find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which<br/>is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life—and it really is<br/>full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long<br/>without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall<br/>hardly know how to make enough of her now."<br/><br/>"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes; next week."<br/><br/>"Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure."<br/>
