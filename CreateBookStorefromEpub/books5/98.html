<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in<br/>Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.<br/>She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required<br/>more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the<br/>subject as they returned;—but it burst out again when she thought<br/>she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor<br/>must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very<br/>plaintive— "Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!" she found something<br/>else must be done.<br/><br/>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss<br/>Bates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.<br/>There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and<br/>Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered<br/>by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as<br/>rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she<br/>ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.<br/><br/>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own<br/>heart, as to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the<br/>persuasion of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome<br/>women— and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the<br/>second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them<br/>for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made<br/>the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going<br/>in—observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she<br/>could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from<br/>Jane Fairfax.<br/><br/>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates<br/>occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very<br/>moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the<br/>visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the<br/>quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the<br/>warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to Miss<br/>Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready to<br/>overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,<br/>solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's<br/>health, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake<br/>from the beaufet—"Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for<br/>ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and<br/>she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked<br/>it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss<br/>Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."<br/><br/>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr.<br/>Elton. There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from<br/>Mr. Elton since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they<br/>must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been<br/>gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite<br/>he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies'<br/>ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the<br/>interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and<br/>always putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a<br/>word.<br/><br/>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but<br/>meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther<br/>incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst<br/>all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.<br/>She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;<br/>but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from<br/>him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her<br/>niece.<br/><br/>
