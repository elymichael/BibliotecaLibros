<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract<br/>her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty<br/>correct. Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second<br/>interview, such she appeared whenever they met<br/>again,—self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.<br/>She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but so little<br/>judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of<br/>the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood; and<br/>conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.<br/>Elton's consequence only could surpass.<br/><br/>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all<br/>differently from his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but<br/>proud. He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought<br/>such a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;<br/>and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,<br/>or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's<br/>good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as<br/>clever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well<br/>satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to<br/>another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily<br/>continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of<br/>her being "very pleasant and very elegantly dressed."<br/><br/>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared<br/>at first. Her feelings altered towards Emma.—Offended, probably, by<br/>the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,<br/>she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and<br/>distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which<br/>produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners,<br/>too—and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were<br/>sneering and negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's<br/>cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk<br/>them both very much.—It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's<br/>attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own<br/>share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to her<br/>and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been given<br/>also. She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.— When<br/>they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin<br/>abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in<br/>open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous<br/>treatment of Harriet.<br/><br/>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the<br/>first. Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might<br/>be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and<br/>she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable<br/>admiration— but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she<br/>must be wanting to assist and befriend her.—Before Emma had<br/>forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their<br/>meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry on the<br/>subject.—<br/><br/>"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite<br/>rave about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and<br/>ladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very<br/>extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays<br/>extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that<br/>point. Oh! she is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my<br/>warmth—but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.— And<br/>her situation is so calculated to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse, we<br/>must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her. We must<br/>bring her forward. Such talent as hers must not be suffered to<br/>remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those charming lines of<br/>the poet,<br/><br/>`Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br/><br/>
