She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ
half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss
Fairfax.— She ought to go—and she was longing to see her; the
resemblance of their present situations increasing every other
motive of goodwill. It would be a secret satisfaction; but the
consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to
the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might
communicate.

She went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had
not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor
Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,
though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.— The
fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of
their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.—
She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor
Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard
nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"—and a
moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming
eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt
sufficient.— Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so
engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was
every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have
wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low,
but very feeling tone,

"This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for
me to express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so
entirely without words."

Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,
if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not
checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and
all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake
of the hand.

Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out,
which accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have
wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have
patience with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual
graciousness, she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.

She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,
and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was
being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted
with what was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of
it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her
own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good
old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of
mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading
aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold
reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,

"We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall
not want opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the
essential already. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S.
admits our apology, and is not offended. You see how delightfully
she writes. Oh! she is a sweet creature! You would have doated on
her, had you gone.—But not a word more. Let us be discreet— quite
on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You remember those lines— I forget the
poem at this moment:

"For when a lady's in the case,

"You know all other things give place."

Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read——mum! a word to
the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set
your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—My representation, you see, has
quite appeased her."

And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs.
Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,
