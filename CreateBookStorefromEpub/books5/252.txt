Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her
where she ought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not,
with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying
the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and
respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong— all
would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have
been.

How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her
thoughts to Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the
chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!— But Harriet was
less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.— Her inferiority,
whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.— She had seemed
more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her, than
she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.— Alas! was not that her own
doing too? Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of
self-consequence but herself?—Who but herself had taught her, that
she was to elevate herself if possible, and that her claims were
great to a high worldly establishment?— If Harriet, from being
humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.
