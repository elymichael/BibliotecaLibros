"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that
already."

"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks
towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might
have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.

"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this
morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what
had happened."

Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little
more composure,

"You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you
have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried
to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a
sinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to
blindness."

For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious
of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm
drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus
saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,

"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own
excellent sense—your exertions for your father's sake—I know you
will not allow yourself—." Her arm was pressed again, as he added,
in a more broken and subdued accent, "The feelings of the warmest
friendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!"— And in a louder,
steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon be gone. They will
soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for her. She deserves a better
fate."

Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the
flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration,
replied,

"You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you
right.— I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness
to what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must
always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and
do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant
conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in
the secret earlier."

"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"—
but checking himself—"No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am
pleased that you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret,
indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes
the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your
affections were not farther entangled!—I could never, I confess,
from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt—
I could only be certain that there was a preference—and a
preference which I never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace
to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young
woman?— Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."

"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really
confused— "I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you
continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave
such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of
confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we
are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in
confessing exactly the reverse.— But I never have."
