<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh<br/>occasion for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been<br/>at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time,<br/>had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner<br/>than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look,<br/>announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was<br/>longing to tell. Half a minute brought it all out. She had heard,<br/>as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been<br/>there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor<br/>particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of<br/>his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had<br/>actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth<br/>to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from<br/>Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage. "Who could<br/>have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what to do.<br/>Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least<br/>she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very<br/>much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she could<br/>to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—" Emma was half-ashamed<br/>of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.<br/><br/>"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to<br/>lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if<br/>he can."<br/><br/>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet. "Pray do. I'd rather<br/>you would."<br/><br/>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized.<br/>The style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were<br/>not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not<br/>have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong<br/>and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the<br/>credit of the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm<br/>attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She<br/>paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her<br/>opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it<br/>a good letter? or is it too short?"<br/><br/>"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather<br/>slowly—"so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I<br/>think one of his sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine<br/>the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could<br/>express himself so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet<br/>it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and<br/>concise; not diffuse enough for a woman. No doubt he is a sensible<br/>man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for—thinks strongly<br/>and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally<br/>find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the<br/>sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain<br/>point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)<br/>than I had expected."<br/><br/>"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;—"well—and—and what shall<br/>I do?"<br/><br/>
