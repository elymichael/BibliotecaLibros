"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a<br/>regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I<br/>believed the general opinion, when I called him plain."<br/><br/>"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The<br/>weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are<br/>too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take<br/>leave. This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall<br/>just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes:<br/>and, Jane, you had better go home directly—I would not have you out<br/>in a shower!—We think she is the better for Highbury already. Thank<br/>you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for<br/>I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: when<br/>we dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to you, my<br/>dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!—I<br/>am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your<br/>arm.—Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!—Good morning to you."<br/><br/>Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by<br/>him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to<br/>marry— and to marry strangers too—and the other half she could give<br/>to her own view of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a<br/>very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not<br/>have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must<br/>feel it—and all that she could hope was, by giving the first<br/>information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from<br/>others. It was now about the time that she was likely to call. If<br/>she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its beginning to<br/>rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be<br/>detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would<br/>undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.<br/><br/>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five<br/>minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look<br/>which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and<br/>the "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!" which<br/>instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding<br/>perturbation. As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not<br/>now shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet,<br/>unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to tell. "She had set<br/>out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago—she had been afraid it<br/>would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every moment—but<br/>she thought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried on as<br/>fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where a<br/>young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would<br/>just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to<br/>stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,<br/>and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as<br/>she could, and took shelter at Ford's."—Ford's was the principal<br/>woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the<br/>shop first in size and fashion in the place.—"And so, there she had<br/>set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,<br/>perhaps—when, all of a sudden, who should come in— to be sure it<br/>was so very odd!—but they always dealt at Ford's— who should come<br/>in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!— Dear Miss Woodhouse!<br/>only think. I thought I should have fainted. I did not know what to<br/>do. I was sitting near the door—Elizabeth saw me directly; but he<br/>did not; he was busy with the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but<br/>she looked away directly, and took no notice; and they both went to<br/>quite the farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near the<br/>door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I must have been as<br/>white as my gown. I could not go away you know, because of the<br/>rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.—Oh!<br/>dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at last, I fancy, he looked round and<br/>saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began<br/>whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I<br/>could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to<br/>me—(do you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came<br/>forward—came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed<br/>ready to shake hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the<br/>same way that she used; I could see she was altered; but, however,<br/>she seemed to try to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and<br/>stood talking some time; but I know no more what I said—I was in<br/>such a tremble!—I remember she said she was sorry we never met now;<br/>which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was<br/>absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to hold up,<br/>and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting<br/>away—and then—only think!— I found he was coming up towards me<br/>too—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do;<br/>and so he came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute,<br/>feeling dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took<br/>courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set;<br/>and I had not got three yards from the door, when he came after me,<br/>only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much<br/>better go round by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near<br/>way quite floated by this rain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have<br/>been the death of me! So I said, I was very much obliged to him:<br/>you know I could not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth,<br/>and I came round by the stables—I believe I did—but I hardly knew<br/>where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I would<br/>rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know, there<br/>was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and<br/>so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me<br/>and make me comfortable again."<br/><br/>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not<br/>immediately in her power. She was obliged to stop and think. She<br/>was not thoroughly comfortable herself. The young man's conduct,<br/>and his sister's, seemed the result of real feeling, and she could<br/>not but pity them. As Harriet described it, there had been an<br/>interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in<br/>their behaviour. But she had believed them to be well-meaning,<br/>worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the<br/>evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of<br/>course, he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry.<br/>Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might<br/>all have hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what<br/>was the value of Harriet's description?—So easily pleased—so little<br/>discerning;— what signified her praise?<br/><br/>She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by<br/>considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite<br/>unworthy of being dwelt on,<br/><br/>"It might be distressing, for the moment," said she; "but you<br/>seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may never—<br/>can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need<br/>not think about it."<br/><br/>Harriet said, "very true," and she "would not think about it;"<br/>but still she talked of it—still she could talk of nothing else;<br/>and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was<br/>obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so<br/>much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or<br/>be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor<br/>Harriet—such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her!<br/><br/>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did<br/>not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day<br/>before, or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before<br/>their first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all<br/>the sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure,<br/>as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the<br/>Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.<br/><br/>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a<br/>meeting. It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock,<br/>without retaining any influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the<br/>Martins could not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto<br/>they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek<br/>her; for since her refusal of the brother, the sisters never had<br/>been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth might pass without their<br/>being thrown together again, with any necessity, or even any power<br/>of speech.<br/><br/><br/>
