<br/>"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting<br/>those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never<br/>entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the<br/>children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only<br/>because they were a little more tired than usual, from their<br/>journey and the happiness of coming. I hope you will think better<br/>of their looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me,<br/>that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether, in such<br/>good case. I trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley<br/>looking ill," turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards<br/>her husband.<br/><br/>"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John<br/>Knightley very far from looking well."<br/><br/>"What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?" cried Mr. John<br/>Knightley, hearing his own name.<br/><br/>"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you<br/>looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I<br/>could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr.<br/>Wingfield before you left home."<br/><br/>"My dear Isabella,"—exclaimed he hastily—"pray do not concern<br/>yourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling<br/>yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse."<br/><br/>"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your<br/>brother," cried Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to<br/>have a bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What<br/>will it answer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?"<br/><br/>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when<br/>forced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she<br/>had nothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane<br/>Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in<br/>general, she was at that moment very happy to assist in<br/>praising.<br/><br/>"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.—<br/>"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a<br/>moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good<br/>old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I<br/>always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be<br/>more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose<br/>Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.<br/>She would be such a delightful companion for Emma."<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,<br/><br/>"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another<br/>pretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not<br/>have a better companion than Harriet."<br/><br/>
