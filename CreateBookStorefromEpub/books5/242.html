"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling<br/>voice. "Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what<br/>you are to hear?"<br/><br/>"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do<br/>guess."<br/><br/>"You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you<br/>directly;" (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking<br/>up.) "He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary<br/>errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak<br/>to his father on a subject,—to announce an attachment—"<br/><br/>She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then<br/>of Harriet.<br/><br/>"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "an<br/>engagement— a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what<br/>will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss<br/>Fairfax are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!"<br/><br/>Emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck,<br/>exclaimed,<br/><br/>"Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting<br/>her eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time<br/>to recover— "You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has<br/>been a solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at<br/>Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing<br/>it but themselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—<br/>It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it<br/>is yet almost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.— I<br/>thought I knew him."<br/><br/>Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between<br/>two ideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;<br/>and poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and<br/>require confirmation, repeated confirmation.<br/><br/>"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is a<br/>circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I<br/>can at all comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—<br/>before either of them came to Highbury?"<br/><br/>"Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma,<br/>very much. It has hurt his father equally. Some part of his conduct<br/>we cannot excuse."<br/>
