"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,<br/>"what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he<br/>ever had any such plan."<br/><br/>"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months<br/>ago."<br/><br/>"Me! impossible!"<br/><br/>"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as<br/>what was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody,<br/>and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her persuasion,<br/>as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of<br/>harm. You must remember it now?"<br/><br/>"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."<br/><br/>"Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must<br/>have dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk<br/>as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at<br/>home."<br/><br/>"What is this?—What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry and<br/>a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad<br/>he can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?"<br/><br/>"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it<br/>from nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's<br/>having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks<br/>ago, with all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard<br/>a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am<br/>a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away—<br/>and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin<br/>dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."<br/><br/>"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have<br/>had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not<br/>very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting<br/>up his carriage! and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care<br/>for his health— just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time<br/>or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability<br/>sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of<br/>absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that<br/>Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a<br/>great dreamer, I think?"<br/><br/>Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to<br/>prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach<br/>of Mr. Weston's hint.<br/>
