<br/>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma<br/>trusted) very foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened<br/>as his wife, though growing very like her;—she spoke some of her<br/>feelings, by observing audibly to her partner,<br/><br/>"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very<br/>goodnatured, I declare."<br/><br/>Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be<br/>heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated<br/>at table and taking up her spoon.<br/><br/>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet.<br/>Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid<br/>there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been<br/>done—One door nailed up—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed<br/>you must. Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put<br/>it on!—so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!— Yes, my dear, I ran<br/>home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back<br/>again, and nobody missed me.—I set off without saying a word, just<br/>as I told you. Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening<br/>with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was<br/>made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came<br/>away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great<br/>deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners.<br/>`Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with<br/>Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself<br/>to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will<br/>ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear sir, you are too<br/>obliging.—Is there nobody you would not rather?—I am not helpless.<br/>Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on<br/>the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is<br/>going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now<br/>we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!—Well,<br/>here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two<br/>steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were<br/>two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but<br/>one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style—Candles<br/>everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane,—There was a<br/>little disappointment.— The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in<br/>their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of<br/>sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.<br/>Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it<br/>all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than<br/>sweetbread and asparagus— so she was rather disappointed, but we<br/>agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its<br/>getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much<br/>concerned!—Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not<br/>have supposed any thing!—Such elegance and profusion!—I have seen<br/>nothing like it since— Well, where shall we sit? where shall we<br/>sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where I sit is of<br/>no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?—Well, I am sure,<br/>Mr. Churchill— only it seems too good—but just as you please. What<br/>you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we<br/>ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I<br/>should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I<br/>cannot help beginning."<br/><br/>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after<br/>supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes<br/>invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm<br/>in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable<br/>rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of<br/>censure.<br/><br/>"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he. "Emma, why<br/>is it that they are your enemies?"<br/><br/>He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer,<br/>added, "She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he<br/>may be.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess,<br/>Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet."<br/><br/>"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."<br/><br/>He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,<br/>and he only said,<br/><br/>"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own<br/>reflections."<br/><br/>
