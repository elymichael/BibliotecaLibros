"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he. "I
shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will
have my sketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to
read—or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself."

"That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never
go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to
leave England."

"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed
for her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going
abroad. I assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this
morning, that I shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired
of doing nothing. I want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,
whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy—I am sick of England— and
would leave it to-morrow, if I could."

"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a
few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"

"I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I
do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am
thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a
fortunate person."

"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.
Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.
Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,
will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."

"No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best
cure."

"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not
Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in
want of a change. You will stay, and go with us?"

"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the
evening."

"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."
