It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;
and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort
in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father
so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too
wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no
weather could keep entirely from them,â€”

"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr.
Elton?"

These days of confinement would have been, but for her private
perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly
suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great
importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly
cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never
failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always
agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But
with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of
delay, there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of
explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever
perfectly at ease.
