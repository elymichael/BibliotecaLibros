<br/>"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no<br/>one preferred to herself.—"You are a humourist, and may say what<br/>you like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me— Jane<br/>and her aunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all<br/>to meeting the Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are<br/>attached to them."<br/><br/>"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call<br/>on Miss Bates in my way home."<br/><br/>"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you<br/>like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a<br/>simple thing. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my<br/>little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,—probably this basket with<br/>pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will<br/>have such another. There is to be no form or parade—a sort of gipsy<br/>party. We are to walk about your gardens, and gather the<br/>strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;—and whatever else you<br/>may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors—a table spread in<br/>the shade, you know. Every thing as natural and simple as possible.<br/>Is not that your idea?"<br/><br/>"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to<br/>have the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the<br/>simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and<br/>furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you<br/>are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold<br/>meat in the house."<br/><br/>"Well—as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by<br/>the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our<br/>opinion?— Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to<br/>Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect anything—"<br/><br/>"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."<br/><br/>"Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is<br/>extremely clever."<br/><br/>"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,<br/>and would spurn any body's assistance."<br/><br/>"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come<br/>on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by.<br/>I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country<br/>life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have<br/>ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always<br/>shut up at home;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is<br/>dust, and in winter there is dirt."<br/><br/>"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell<br/>Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey,<br/>however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish<br/>every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."<br/><br/>
