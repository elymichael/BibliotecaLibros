<br/>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human<br/>disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little<br/>disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though<br/>the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very<br/>material.— Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting<br/>heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of<br/>his.<br/><br/>He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.<br/>He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.<br/>He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's<br/>engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of<br/>endeavouring, if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to<br/>counsel her.—The rest had been the work of the moment, the<br/>immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The delightful<br/>assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her<br/>having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to<br/>the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;—but<br/>it had been no present hope—he had only, in the momentary conquest<br/>of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not<br/>forbid his attempt to attach her.—The superior hopes which<br/>gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.— The affection,<br/>which he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was<br/>already his!—Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly<br/>distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness,<br/>that it could bear no other name.<br/><br/>Her change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the<br/>same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the<br/>same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there<br/>had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the<br/>expectation, of Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and<br/>jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one<br/>sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other. It was<br/>his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the<br/>country.—The Box Hill party had decided him on going away. He would<br/>save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged<br/>attentions.—He had gone to learn to be indifferent.— But he had<br/>gone to a wrong place. There was too much domestic happiness in his<br/>brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was<br/>too much like Emma—differing only in those striking inferiorities,<br/>which always brought the other in brilliancy before him, for much<br/>to have been done, even had his time been longer.—He had stayed on,<br/>however, vigorously, day after day—till this very morning's post<br/>had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then, with the gladness<br/>which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having<br/>never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was<br/>there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that<br/>he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and<br/>had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and<br/>best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore<br/>the discovery.<br/><br/>He had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a<br/>villain.— He heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank<br/>Churchill's character was not desperate.—She was his own Emma, by<br/>hand and word, when they returned into the house; and if he could<br/>have thought of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a<br/>very good sort of fellow.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
