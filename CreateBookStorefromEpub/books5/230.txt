"Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a
charming wife."

"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for
nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I
return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember."

Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to
touch every favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very
creature described? Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make
her all that he wished. He might even have Harriet in his thoughts
at the moment; who could say? Referring the education to her seemed
to imply it.

"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs.
Elton?"

"If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I
was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We
shall soon overtake her. There she is—no, that's somebody else.
That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like
her.— Well, I declare—"

They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.
Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young
man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew
tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather
walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost
alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the
beautiful views beneath her. The appearance of the servants looking
out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;
and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the
solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first, were gladly
endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close
the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such
another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped
never to be betrayed into again.

While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her
side. He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and
then said,

"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:
a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still
use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How
could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so
insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and
situation?— Emma, I had not thought it possible."

Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it
off.

"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have
helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not
understand me."

"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has
talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of
it— with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard
her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such
attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your
father, when her society must be so irksome."
