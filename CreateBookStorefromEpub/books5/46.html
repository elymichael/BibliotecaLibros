Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br/><br/>And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br/><br/>Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,<br/><br/>May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br/><br/>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it<br/>through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines,<br/>and then passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to<br/>herself, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the<br/>confusion of hope and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well<br/>indeed. I have read worse charades. Courtship—a very good hint. I<br/>give you credit for it. This is feeling your way. This is saying<br/>very plainly—`Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses<br/>to you. Approve my charade and my intentions in the same<br/>glance.'<br/><br/>May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br/><br/>Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all<br/>epithets, the justest that could be given.<br/><br/>Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.<br/><br/>Humph—Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very<br/>much in love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish<br/>you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For<br/>once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An<br/>excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must<br/>come to a crisis soon now.<br/><br/>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant<br/>observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great<br/>length, by the eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.<br/><br/>"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an<br/>idea—I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do<br/>try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any<br/>thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who<br/>could be the young lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be<br/>woman?<br/>
