"No—It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be
cross."

"Then pray stay at Richmond."

"But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to
think of you all there without me."

"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.
Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more."

The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon
collected. With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank
Churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very
general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance
being explained. That it was time for every body to go, concluded
the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day's
scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's little inclination to
exclude himself increased so much, that his last words to Emma
were,

"Well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will."

She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from
Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.
