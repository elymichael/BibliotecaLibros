He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to<br/>speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.<br/><br/>"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his eyes towards<br/>Jane. "Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and<br/>Mrs. Weston doat upon her."<br/><br/>But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,<br/>after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the<br/>name of Dixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in<br/>her hearing.<br/><br/>"I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme<br/>shame."<br/><br/>"The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be. But is<br/>it possible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I<br/>know, you had none."<br/><br/>"I never had the smallest, I assure you."<br/><br/>"That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I<br/>had— it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong<br/>things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no<br/>service.— It would have been a much better transgression had I<br/>broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing."<br/><br/>"It is not now worth a regret," said Emma.<br/><br/>"I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded<br/>to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When<br/>the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and<br/>continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.—But now,<br/>I am at such a distance from her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—<br/>Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of<br/>reconciliation. Do not you pity me?"<br/><br/>Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession<br/>of gay thought, he cried,<br/><br/>"Ah! by the bye," then sinking his voice, and looking demure for<br/>the moment—"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?" He paused.—She coloured<br/>and laughed.—"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember<br/>my wish in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.— I<br/>assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and<br/>satisfaction.—He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise."<br/>
