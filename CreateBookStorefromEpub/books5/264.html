He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,<br/>with a smile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But<br/>it is his way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's.<br/>We will not be severe."<br/><br/>"It will be natural for me," he added shortly afterwards, "to<br/>speak my opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I<br/>am near you. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you<br/>dislike it—"<br/><br/>"Not at all. I should wish it."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.<br/><br/>"He trifles here," said he, "as to the temptation. He knows he<br/>is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to<br/>have formed the engagement.—`His father's disposition:'— he is<br/>unjust, however, to his father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a<br/>blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr.<br/>Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain<br/>it.—Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here."<br/><br/>"And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that<br/>he might have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very<br/>handsomely— but you were perfectly right."<br/><br/>"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I<br/>think— had you not been in the case—I should still have distrusted<br/>him."<br/><br/>When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole<br/>of it aloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake<br/>of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely<br/>of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously,<br/>and, after steady reflection, thus—<br/><br/>"Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most<br/>dangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—<br/>No judge of his own manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his<br/>own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.—<br/>Fancying you to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!— his own<br/>mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in<br/>others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert the understanding! My<br/>Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty<br/>of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?"<br/><br/>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's<br/>account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.<br/><br/>"You had better go on," said she.<br/>
