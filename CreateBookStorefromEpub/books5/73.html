<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs.<br/>John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every<br/>morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and<br/>talking over what she had done every evening with her father and<br/>sister. She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did<br/>not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being<br/>much too short.<br/><br/>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than<br/>their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the<br/>house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston<br/>would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even<br/>Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in<br/>preference to a division of the party.<br/><br/>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a<br/>difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and<br/>horses were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more<br/>than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;<br/>nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one<br/>of the carriages find room for Harriet also.<br/><br/>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,<br/>were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be<br/>early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and<br/>inclination being consulted in every thing.<br/><br/>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great<br/>event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December)<br/>had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so<br/>much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of<br/>being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to<br/>leave the house. Emma called on her the next day, and found her<br/>doom already signed with regard to Randalls. She was very feverish<br/>and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and<br/>affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill<br/>and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this<br/>delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss<br/>without many tears.<br/><br/>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs.<br/>Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by<br/>representing how much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew<br/>her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet<br/>dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all<br/>missing her very much. She had not advanced many yards from Mrs.<br/>Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently<br/>coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in<br/>conversation about the invalid— of whom he, on the rumour of<br/>considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might<br/>carry some report of her to Hartfield— they were overtaken by Mr.<br/>John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his<br/>two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the<br/>benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of<br/>the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for.<br/>They joined company and proceeded together. Emma was just<br/>describing the nature of her friend's complaint;— "a throat very<br/>much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low<br/>pulse, &amp;c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that<br/>Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed<br/>her with them." Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he<br/>exclaimed,<br/><br/>
