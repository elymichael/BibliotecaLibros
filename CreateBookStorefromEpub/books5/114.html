<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before<br/>her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led<br/>her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to<br/>The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the<br/>operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to<br/>convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,<br/>excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a<br/>blank.<br/><br/>She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was<br/>to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which<br/>led between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of<br/>every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,<br/>was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they<br/>parted, Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of<br/>fearful curiosity, which determined her not to allow the visit to<br/>exceed the proposed quarter of an hour. She went on herself, to<br/>give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and<br/>settled in Donwell.<br/><br/>The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate<br/>again; and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without<br/>delay, and unattended by any alarming young man. She came<br/>solitarily down the gravel walk—a Miss Martin just appearing at the<br/>door, and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.<br/><br/>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She<br/>was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to<br/>understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was<br/>creating. She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had<br/>received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the<br/>merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time— till just<br/>at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she<br/>thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting<br/>subject, and a warmer manner. In that very room she had been<br/>measured last September, with her two friends. There were the<br/>pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window. He<br/>had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the<br/>party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the same<br/>regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and<br/>they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma<br/>must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and<br/>happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style<br/>of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be<br/>decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had<br/>thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!—Emma could not but<br/>picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how<br/>naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She would<br/>have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the<br/>Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a<br/>little higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she<br/>have done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could not repent. They must be<br/>separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process— so<br/>much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a<br/>little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls<br/>to procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the<br/>Martins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that<br/>neither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both been out<br/>some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.<br/><br/>"This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away. "And now we<br/>shall just miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been<br/>so disappointed." And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her<br/>murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both— such<br/>being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently<br/>the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs.<br/>Weston, who were standing to speak to her. There was instant<br/>pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was<br/>conveyed in sound—for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with,<br/><br/>
