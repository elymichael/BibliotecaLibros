"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to
you," said Mr. Weston.

Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment
intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," he
continued— "and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my
name."

"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am
sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall
both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."

"You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am
sure.— He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice
of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,
and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it—though it was not
directed to me—it was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal
correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter."

"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.
Weston— (laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most
dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours
follow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,
we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I
could not have believed it of you!"
