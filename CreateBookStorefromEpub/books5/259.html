"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried.<br/>"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."<br/><br/>"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and<br/>not another syllable followed.<br/><br/>Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide<br/>in her— perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would, she would<br/>listen. She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;<br/>she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him<br/>his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,<br/>which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind<br/>as his.—They had reached the house.<br/><br/>"You are going in, I suppose?" said he.<br/><br/>"No,"—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in<br/>which he still spoke—"I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry<br/>is not gone." And, after proceeding a few steps, she added— "I<br/>stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am<br/>afraid, gave you pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to<br/>me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have<br/>in contemplation—as a friend, indeed, you may command me.—I will<br/>hear whatever you like. I will tell you exactly what I think."<br/><br/>"As a friend!"—repeated Mr. Knightley.—"Emma, that I fear is a<br/>word—No, I have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?— I have<br/>gone too far already for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—<br/>Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you<br/>as a friend.—Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever<br/>succeeding?"<br/><br/>He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the<br/>expression of his eyes overpowered her.<br/><br/>"My dearest Emma," said he, "for dearest you will always be,<br/>whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most<br/>beloved Emma—tell me at once. Say `No,' if it is to be said."— She<br/>could really say nothing.—"You are silent," he cried, with great<br/>animation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."<br/><br/>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this<br/>moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was<br/>perhaps the most prominent feeling.<br/><br/>"I cannot make speeches, Emma:" he soon resumed; and in a tone<br/>of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably<br/>convincing.—"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it<br/>more. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I<br/>have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no<br/>other woman in England would have borne it.— Bear with the truths I<br/>would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with<br/>them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them.<br/>God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.— But you<br/>understand me.—Yes, you see, you understand my feelings— and will<br/>return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to<br/>hear your voice."<br/><br/>While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the<br/>wonderful velocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing<br/>a word— to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to<br/>see that Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a<br/>delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was<br/>nothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had been<br/>saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of<br/>her own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her<br/>reluctance, her discouragement, had been all received as<br/>discouragement from herself.—And not only was there time for these<br/>convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was<br/>time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and<br/>to resolve that it need not, and should not.—It was all the service<br/>she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism<br/>of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to<br/>transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the<br/>most worthy of the two— or even the more simple sublimity of<br/>resolving to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing<br/>any motive, because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not.<br/>She felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight<br/>of generosity run mad, opposing all that could be probable or<br/>reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her friend astray, and<br/>it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgment was as<br/>strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever been before,<br/>in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal and<br/>degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.—She spoke<br/>then, on being so entreated.— What did she say?—Just what she<br/>ought, of course. A lady always does.— She said enough to shew<br/>there need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself. He<br/>had despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to<br/>caution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;—she had<br/>begun by refusing to hear him.—The change had perhaps been somewhat<br/>sudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the<br/>conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little<br/>extraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so<br/>obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.<br/>
