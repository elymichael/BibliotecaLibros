"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."

"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,
means just nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever
seen a man she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be
very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma
in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. But
there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom
from home."

"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her
resolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be; and
while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming
any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor
Mr. Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to
Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."

Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of
her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There
were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not
desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which
Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "What does Weston think of
the weather; shall we have rain?" convinced her that he had nothing
more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
