<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's<br/>youngest daughter.<br/><br/>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ______________ regiment of<br/>infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and<br/>pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save<br/>the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad—of his<br/>widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards—and this<br/>girl.<br/><br/>By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old,<br/>on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the<br/>consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had<br/>seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of<br/>her being taught only what very limited means could command, and<br/>growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be<br/>engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good<br/>understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.<br/><br/>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a<br/>change to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very<br/>highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving<br/>young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such<br/>attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved<br/>his life. These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,<br/>though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,<br/>before his own return to England put any thing in his power. When<br/>he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her. He<br/>was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's<br/>age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and<br/>growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,<br/>his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a<br/>real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of<br/>undertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and<br/>from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family,<br/>and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother<br/>from time to time.<br/><br/>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;<br/>the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father<br/>making independence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was<br/>out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay and<br/>appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be<br/>all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be<br/>supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.<br/><br/>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands,<br/>known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an<br/>excellent education. Living constantly with right-minded and<br/>well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received<br/>every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's<br/>residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full<br/>justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. Her<br/>disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that<br/>friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as<br/>such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully<br/>competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too<br/>much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could<br/>promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put<br/>off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane<br/>remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the<br/>rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture<br/>of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the<br/>sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her<br/>that all this might soon be over.<br/><br/>
