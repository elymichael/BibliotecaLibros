<br/>"How?—They were invited, were not they?"<br/><br/>"Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their<br/>coming?"<br/><br/>"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?"<br/><br/>"Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very<br/>sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at<br/>night, and cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her,<br/>though I never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that<br/>she was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take<br/>cold. Poor girl! I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as<br/>Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to<br/>him about the carriage. You may guess how readily he came into my<br/>wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss<br/>Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service<br/>before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her<br/>comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible,<br/>you may be sure. `Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'—but<br/>with many, many thanks—`there was no occasion to trouble us, for<br/>Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and was to take them home<br/>again.' I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really<br/>quite surprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an<br/>attention!— the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And,<br/>in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to<br/>think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at<br/>all. I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for<br/>himself, and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them."<br/><br/>"Very likely," said Emma—"nothing more likely. I know no man<br/>more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any<br/>thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He<br/>is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,<br/>considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of<br/>humanity to him;—and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there<br/>is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he<br/>had horses to-day—for we arrived together; and I laughed at him<br/>about it, but he said not a word that could betray."<br/><br/>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give him credit for more<br/>simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for<br/>while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and<br/>I have never been able to get it out again. The more I think of it,<br/>the more probable it appears. In short, I have made a match between<br/>Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you<br/>company!—What do you say to it?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!" exclaimed Emma. "Dear Mrs.<br/>Weston, how could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr.<br/>Knightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out<br/>from Donwell?— Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all<br/>consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all<br/>likely. I am amazed that you should think of such a thing."<br/><br/>"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do<br/>not want the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry— but<br/>the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley<br/>really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's<br/>account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the<br/>matter?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.— Mr.<br/>Knightley marry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot<br/>adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"<br/><br/>"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you<br/>very well know."<br/><br/>
