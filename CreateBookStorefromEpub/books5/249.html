<br/>"I should not have thought it possible," she began, "that you<br/>could have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—<br/>but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I<br/>should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to<br/>mean any other person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know<br/>who would ever look at him in the company of the other. I hope I<br/>have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is<br/>like nobody by his side. And that you should have been so mistaken,<br/>is amazing!—I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved<br/>and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have<br/>considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to<br/>think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful<br/>things had happened; that there had been matches of greater<br/>disparity (those were your very words);— I should not have dared to<br/>give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if you, who<br/>had been always acquainted with him—"<br/><br/>"Harriet!" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely—"Let us<br/>understand each other now, without the possibility of farther<br/>mistake. Are you speaking of—Mr. Knightley?"<br/><br/>"To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—<br/>and so I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as<br/>clear as possible."<br/><br/>"Not quite," returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that<br/>you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I<br/>could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. I am<br/>sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in<br/>protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."<br/><br/>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"<br/><br/>"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I<br/>said on the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your<br/>attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it<br/>was extremely natural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself<br/>very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even<br/>what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your<br/>rescue.—The impression of it is strong on my memory."<br/><br/>"Oh, dear," cried Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I<br/>was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not<br/>the gipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with<br/>some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious<br/>circumstance— of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance,<br/>when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no<br/>other partner in the room. That was the kind action; that was the<br/>noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made<br/>me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon<br/>earth."<br/><br/>"Good God!" cried Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate— most<br/>deplorable mistake!—What is to be done?"<br/><br/>"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood<br/>me? At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have<br/>been, if the other had been the person; and now—it is<br/>possible—"<br/><br/>She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.<br/><br/>
