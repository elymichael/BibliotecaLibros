Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss<br/>Bates keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came—"Very happy<br/>and obliged"—but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the<br/>same cheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner. A<br/>very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the<br/>way to a return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.<br/><br/>"Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—<br/>and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy,<br/>indeed, in me—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very<br/>trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and<br/>she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:—<br/>such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and<br/>Mrs. Dixon. `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'— for tears<br/>were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder.<br/>It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a<br/>situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on<br/>first going out—do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for<br/>such surprising good fortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor<br/>dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. When one is<br/>in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it<br/>may deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her, nobody<br/>would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a<br/>situation. You will excuse her not coming to you—she is not<br/>able—she is gone into her own room— I want her to lie down upon the<br/>bed. `My dear,' said I, `I shall say you are laid down upon the<br/>bed:' but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But,<br/>now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be<br/>well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss<br/>Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting<br/>at the door—I was quite ashamed— but somehow there was a little<br/>bustle—for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till<br/>you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. `It is<br/>only Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon it. Nobody else would come so<br/>early.' `Well,' said she, `it must be borne some time or other, and<br/>it may as well be now.' But then Patty came in, and said it was<br/>you. `Oh!' said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like<br/>to see her.'— `I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and<br/>would go away; and that was what made us keep you waiting—and<br/>extremely sorry and ashamed we were. `If you must go, my dear,'<br/>said I, `you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the<br/>bed.'"<br/><br/>Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long<br/>growing kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present<br/>sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion,<br/>and left her nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just<br/>and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that<br/>Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other<br/>steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself. She spoke as<br/>she felt, with earnest regret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that<br/>the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now<br/>actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's<br/>advantage and comfort as possible. "It must be a severe trial to<br/>them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel<br/>Campbell's return."<br/><br/>"So very kind!" replied Miss Bates. "But you are always<br/>kind."<br/><br/>There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through her<br/>dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of—<br/><br/>"Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?"<br/><br/>"To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the<br/>charge of her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible<br/>that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we<br/>except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but<br/>Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very same<br/>neighbourhood:—lives only four miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be<br/>only four miles from Maple Grove."<br/><br/>"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax<br/>owes—"<br/><br/>"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend.<br/>She would not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, `No;' for<br/>when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the<br/>very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she<br/>was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons<br/>you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close<br/>with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should<br/>induce her to enter into any engagement at present—and so she told<br/>Mrs. Elton over and over again—and I am sure I had no more idea<br/>that she would change her mind!—but that good Mrs. Elton, whose<br/>judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did. It is not every<br/>body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and<br/>refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she would<br/>not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would<br/>wait—and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that<br/>Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least<br/>idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon<br/>thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she<br/>had come to the resolution of accepting it.—I did not know a word<br/>of it till it was all settled."<br/><br/>"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"<br/><br/>"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled<br/>so, upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley.<br/>`You must all spend your evening with us,' said she—`I positively<br/>must have you all come.'"<br/>
