<br/>"None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no<br/>being in the world but their two selves."<br/><br/>"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled<br/>to the idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think<br/>it a very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a<br/>system of hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?— To come<br/>among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a<br/>league in secret to judge us all!—Here have we been, the whole<br/>winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an<br/>equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of<br/>us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in<br/>judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to<br/>hear.—They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other<br/>spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"<br/><br/>"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston. "I am very<br/>sure that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both<br/>might not have heard."<br/><br/>"You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when<br/>you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."<br/><br/>"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of<br/>Miss Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of<br/>her; and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been<br/>safe."<br/><br/>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the<br/>window, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which<br/>invited him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now,<br/>dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that<br/>may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the<br/>match. Let us make the best of it—and, indeed, almost every thing<br/>may be fairly said in her favour. It is not a connexion to gratify;<br/>but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it may<br/>be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that<br/>he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of<br/>character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for—<br/>and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one<br/>great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may be<br/>said in her situation for even that error!"<br/><br/>"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly. "If a woman can ever be<br/>excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like<br/>Jane Fairfax's.—Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is not<br/>their's, nor the world's law.'"<br/><br/>She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,<br/>exclaiming,<br/><br/>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!<br/>This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and<br/>exercise my talent of guessing. But you really frightened me. I<br/>thought you had lost half your property, at least. And here,<br/>instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one<br/>of congratulation.—I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my<br/>heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and<br/>accomplished young women in England for your daughter."<br/><br/>A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all<br/>was as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his<br/>spirits was immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual<br/>briskness: he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and<br/>entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only<br/>wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad<br/>thing. His companions suggested only what could palliate<br/>imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked<br/>it all over together, and he had talked it all over again with<br/>Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly<br/>reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that<br/>Frank could possibly have done.<br/><br/>
