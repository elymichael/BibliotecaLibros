<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel<br/>with herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than<br/>usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,<br/>his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry,<br/>but could not repent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings<br/>were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general<br/>appearances of the next few days.<br/><br/>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after<br/>Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the<br/>common sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his<br/>half sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's<br/>feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and<br/>steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma<br/>was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise<br/>remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the<br/>utmost advantage to the latter.<br/><br/>Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal<br/>of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than<br/>a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It<br/>was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her<br/>imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be<br/>labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober<br/>facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at<br/>present, the only mental provision she was making for the evening<br/>of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of<br/>every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of<br/>hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with<br/>ciphers and trophies.<br/><br/>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand<br/>scale are not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,<br/>had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken<br/>the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,<br/>to get a great many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory<br/>and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely<br/>to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as<br/>quantity.<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as<br/>the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their<br/>putting in. "So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was<br/>youngâ€”he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he<br/>should in time." And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen<br/>maid."<br/><br/>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the<br/>subject, did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;<br/>but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about<br/>so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.<br/><br/>
