"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think of<br/>any tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to<br/>inquire about of his housekeeper—no message from my father."<br/><br/>She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence<br/>of some minutes, Harriet thus began again—<br/><br/>"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,<br/>or going to be married! so charming as you are!"—<br/><br/>Emma laughed, and replied,<br/><br/>"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to<br/>marry; I must find other people charming—one other person at least.<br/>And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have<br/>very little intention of ever marrying at all."<br/><br/>"Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it."<br/><br/>"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,<br/>to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out<br/>of the question: and I do not wish to see any such person. I would<br/>rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I<br/>were to marry, I must expect to repent it."<br/><br/>"Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"—<br/><br/>"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I<br/>to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never<br/>have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not<br/>think I ever shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool<br/>to change such a situation as mine. Fortune I do not want;<br/>employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few<br/>married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as<br/>I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly<br/>beloved and important; so always first and always right in any<br/>man's eyes as I am in my father's."<br/><br/>"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"<br/><br/>"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet;<br/>and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so<br/>satisfied— so smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and<br/>unfastidious— and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body<br/>about me, I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced<br/>there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."<br/>
