"This present from the Campbells," said she—"this pianoforte is<br/>very kindly given."<br/><br/>"Yes," he replied, and without the smallest apparent<br/>embarrassment.— "But they would have done better had they given her<br/>notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not<br/>enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should<br/>have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell."<br/><br/>From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr.<br/>Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether<br/>he were entirely free from peculiar attachment—whether there were<br/>no actual preference—remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the<br/>end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick.<br/><br/>"That will do," said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—<br/>"you have sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet."<br/><br/>Another song, however, was soon begged for. "One more;—they<br/>would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask<br/>for one more." And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you<br/>could manage this without effort; the first part is so very<br/>trifling. The strength of the song falls on the second."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley grew angry.<br/><br/>"That fellow," said he, indignantly, "thinks of nothing but<br/>shewing off his own voice. This must not be." And touching Miss<br/>Bates, who at that moment passed near—"Miss Bates, are you mad, to<br/>let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and<br/>interfere. They have no mercy on her."<br/><br/>Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even<br/>to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all<br/>farther singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for<br/>Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady<br/>performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing—<br/>originating nobody exactly knew where—was so effectually promoted<br/>by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,<br/>to give proper space. Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,<br/>was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank<br/>Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had<br/>secured her hand, and led her up to the top.<br/><br/>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves<br/>off, Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving<br/>on her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of<br/>Mr. Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general.<br/>If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might<br/>augur something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was<br/>talking to Mrs. Cole— he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked<br/>by somebody else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.<br/><br/>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet<br/>safe; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.<br/>Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the<br/>suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself<br/>well matched in a partner. They were a couple worth looking at.<br/><br/>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It<br/>was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her<br/>mother's account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted<br/>to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look<br/>sorrowful, and have done.<br/>
