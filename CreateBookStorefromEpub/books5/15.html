As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close<br/>of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard,<br/>requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss<br/>Smith with her; a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl<br/>of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt<br/>an interest in, on account of her beauty. A very gracious<br/>invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the<br/>fair mistress of the mansion.<br/><br/>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had<br/>placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and<br/>somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to<br/>that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of<br/>her history. She had no visible friends but what had been acquired<br/>at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the<br/>country to some young ladies who had been at school there with<br/>her.<br/><br/>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a<br/>sort which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and<br/>fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,<br/>and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,<br/>Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite<br/>determined to continue the acquaintance.<br/><br/>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss<br/>Smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very<br/>engaging—not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so<br/>far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference,<br/>seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and<br/>so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so<br/>superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must have<br/>good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be<br/>given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should<br/>not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its<br/>connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy<br/>of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good<br/>sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the<br/>name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a<br/>large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of<br/>Donwell—very creditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley<br/>thought highly of them—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and<br/>very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little<br/>more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect. She would notice<br/>her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad<br/>acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form<br/>her opinions and her manners. It would be an interesting, and<br/>certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own<br/>situation in life, her leisure, and powers.<br/><br/>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and<br/>listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that<br/>the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,<br/>which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used<br/>to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved<br/>forwards to the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond<br/>the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to<br/>the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real<br/>good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do<br/>all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced<br/>chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would<br/>be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their<br/>guests.<br/><br/>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad<br/>warfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the<br/>fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very<br/>unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and<br/>while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every<br/>thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would<br/>eat.<br/><br/>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that<br/>he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he<br/>might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing<br/>the nicer things, to say:<br/><br/>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.<br/>An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands<br/>boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg<br/>boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very<br/>small, you see—one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates,<br/>let Emma help you to a little bit of tart—a very little bit. Ours<br/>are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome<br/>preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say<br/>you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler<br/>of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."<br/><br/>Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a<br/>much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had<br/>particular pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of<br/>Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so<br/>great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the<br/>introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,<br/>grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,<br/>delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated<br/>her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at<br/>last!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
