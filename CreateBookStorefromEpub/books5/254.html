"Poor girl!" said Emma. "She thinks herself wrong, then, for<br/>having consented to a private engagement?"<br/><br/>"Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is<br/>disposed to blame herself. `The consequence,' said she, `has been a<br/>state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all<br/>the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less<br/>misconduct. Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have<br/>been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate<br/>turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now<br/>receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.' `Do not<br/>imagine, madam,' she continued, `that I was taught wrong. Do not<br/>let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the<br/>friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do<br/>assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may<br/>appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel<br/>Campbell.'"<br/><br/>"Poor girl!" said Emma again. "She loves him then excessively, I<br/>suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be<br/>led to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her<br/>judgment."<br/><br/>"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to<br/>him."<br/><br/>"I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have<br/>contributed to make her unhappy."<br/><br/>"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she<br/>probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to<br/>the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One<br/>natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in," she<br/>said, "was that of making her unreasonable. The consciousness of<br/>having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and<br/>made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been—<br/>that had been—hard for him to bear. `I did not make the<br/>allowances,' said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper<br/>and spirits— his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that<br/>playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances,<br/>would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they<br/>were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the great<br/>kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush<br/>which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I<br/>had an opportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for<br/>every wish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible<br/>that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from<br/>herself."<br/><br/>"If I did not know her to be happy now," said Emma, seriously,<br/>"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous<br/>conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh!<br/>Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the<br/>good I have done Miss Fairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying<br/>to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind<br/>to bring me these interesting particulars. They shew her to the<br/>greatest advantage. I am sure she is very good— I hope she will be<br/>very happy. It is fit that the fortune should be on his side, for I<br/>think the merit will be all on hers."<br/><br/>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She<br/>thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,<br/>she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.<br/>She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal<br/>affection— but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it<br/>was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to<br/>attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not<br/>yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it<br/>will soon come," she was obliged to pause before she answered, and<br/>at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at all<br/>recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.<br/><br/>"Are you well, my Emma?" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.<br/><br/>"Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me<br/>intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for<br/>unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and<br/>her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly<br/>regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and<br/>blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some<br/>measure, the cause. Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes,<br/>in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her<br/>due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part<br/>towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there<br/>instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have<br/>been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.—Birth,<br/>abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an<br/>associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the<br/>other—what was she?—Supposing even that they had never become<br/>intimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss<br/>Fairfax's confidence on this important matter— which was most<br/>probable—still, in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she<br/>must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an<br/>improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so<br/>foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably<br/>imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject<br/>of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the<br/>levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of<br/>evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was<br/>persuaded that she must herself have been the worst. She must have<br/>been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three<br/>together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a<br/>thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony<br/>of a mind that would bear no more.<br/>
