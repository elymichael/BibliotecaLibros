<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The weather continued much the same all the following morning;<br/>and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign<br/>at Hartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into<br/>a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it<br/>was summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition<br/>gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never<br/>had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil,<br/>warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She<br/>longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr.<br/>Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give<br/>her father, she lost no time ill hurrying into the<br/>shrubbery.—There, with spirits freshened, and thoughts a little<br/>relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr. Knightley<br/>passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.—It was the<br/>first intimation of his being returned from London. She had been<br/>thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles<br/>distant.—There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind.<br/>She must be collected and calm.

He was silent. She thought he was often<br/>looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it<br/>suited her to give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps<br/>he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might<br/>be watching for encouragement to begin.—She did not, could not,<br/>feel equal to lead the way to any such subject. He must do it all<br/>himself. Yet she could not bear this silence. With him it was most<br/>unnatural. She considered—resolved—and, trying to smile, began—<br/><br/>"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will<br/>rather surprize you."<br/><br/>"Have I?" said he quietly, and looking at her; "of what<br/>nature?"<br/><br/>"Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding."<br/><br/>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no<br/>more, he replied,<br/><br/>
