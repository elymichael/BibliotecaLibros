"I certainly must," said she. "This sensation of listlessness,
weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ
myself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about
the house!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in
the world if I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to
some is always good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners
for the ball, if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be
happy. He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now
if he likes."

Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could
not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful
look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very
steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others,
and with considerable kindness added,

"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are
really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"

It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her
honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her
composure was odious. She had been particularly unwell, however,
suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,
that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have
attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming
indifference to the languor of ill-health.
