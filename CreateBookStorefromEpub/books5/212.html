<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened<br/>upon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material<br/>change. The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the<br/>Sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and<br/>Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of<br/>the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead<br/>of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two<br/>months longer, provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs.<br/>Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from being<br/>hurried into a delightful situation against her will.<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had<br/>certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only<br/>growing to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double<br/>dealing in his pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared<br/>indisputable. Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his<br/>father's hints, his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in<br/>unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same<br/>story. But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma<br/>herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect<br/>him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He could not<br/>understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between<br/>them—he thought so at least— symptoms of admiration on his side,<br/>which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think<br/>entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of<br/>Emma's errors of imagination. She was not present when the<br/>suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and<br/>Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had seen a look, more than a single<br/>look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse,<br/>seemed somewhat out of place. When he was again in their company,<br/>he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid<br/>observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at<br/>twilight,<br/><br/>"Myself creating what I saw,"<br/><br/>brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of<br/>private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank<br/>Churchill and Jane.<br/><br/>He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to<br/>spend his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to<br/>walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger<br/>party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their<br/>exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston<br/>and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.<br/>They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew<br/>it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her<br/>father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. The<br/>Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long<br/>speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also<br/>found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging<br/>invitation.<br/><br/>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on<br/>horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.<br/><br/>
