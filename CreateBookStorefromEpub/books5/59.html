<br/>"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so<br/>dreadful!"<br/><br/>"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is<br/>poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous<br/>public! A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a<br/>ridiculous, disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and<br/>girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,<br/>and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else. And the<br/>distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common<br/>sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income<br/>has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. Those who<br/>can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and<br/>generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.<br/>This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good<br/>natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much<br/>to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty<br/>certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had<br/>only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away<br/>sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great<br/>charm."<br/><br/>"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself<br/>when you grow old?"<br/><br/>"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a<br/>great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I<br/>should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than<br/>one-and-twenty. Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be<br/>as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation.<br/>If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take<br/>to carpet-work. And as for objects of interest, objects for the<br/>affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the<br/>want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not<br/>marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a<br/>sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough of them,<br/>in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that<br/>declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and<br/>every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a<br/>parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and<br/>blinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with<br/>me."<br/><br/>"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have<br/>seen her a hundred times—but are you acquainted?"<br/><br/>"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she<br/>comes to Highbury. By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out<br/>of conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should<br/>ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together, as<br/>she does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane<br/>Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty times over; her<br/>compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she<br/>does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair<br/>of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a<br/>month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to<br/>death."<br/><br/>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were<br/>superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the<br/>poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and<br/>kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She<br/>understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their<br/>temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue<br/>from those for whom education had done so little; entered into<br/>their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance<br/>with as much intelligence as good-will. In the present instance, it<br/>was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and<br/>after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,<br/>she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as<br/>made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,<br/><br/>"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling<br/>they make every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think<br/>of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and<br/>yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"<br/><br/>"Very true," said Harriet. "Poor creatures! one can think of<br/>nothing else."<br/><br/>"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,"<br/>said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep<br/>which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,<br/>and brought them into the lane again. "I do not think it will,"<br/>stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the<br/>place, and recall the still greater within.<br/><br/>
