<br/>"I mean that he has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with<br/>smiling but determined decision, "and been accepted."<br/><br/>"Good God!" she cried.—"Well!"—Then having recourse to her<br/>workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all<br/>the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew<br/>she must be expressing, she added, "Well, now tell me every thing;<br/>make this intelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all.<br/>I never was more surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I<br/>assure you.—How—how has it been possible?"<br/><br/>"It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three<br/>days ago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was<br/>wanting to send to John.—He delivered these papers to John, at his<br/>chambers, and was asked by him to join their party the same evening<br/>to Astley's. They were going to take the two eldest boys to<br/>Astley's. The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry,<br/>John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not resist. They called<br/>for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother<br/>asked him to dine with them the next day—which he did—and in the<br/>course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of<br/>speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.—She made<br/>him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. He came<br/>down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this morning immediately<br/>after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs,<br/>and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of the how,<br/>where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer<br/>history when you see her.— She will give you all the minute<br/>particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.—In<br/>our communications we deal only in the great.—However, I must say,<br/>that Robert Martin's heart seemed for him, and to me, very<br/>overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the<br/>purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took<br/>charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with<br/>Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a<br/>crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy."<br/><br/>He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To<br/>speak, she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree<br/>of happiness. She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.<br/>Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,<br/>he added,<br/><br/>"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now<br/>make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you<br/>expected. His situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what<br/>satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better<br/>and better of him as you know him more. His good sense and good<br/>principles would delight you.—As far as the man is concerned, you<br/>could not wish your friend in better hands. His rank in society I<br/>would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you,<br/>Emma.—You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as<br/>ill spare Robert Martin."<br/><br/>He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought<br/>herself not to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,<br/><br/>"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I<br/>think Harriet is doing extremely well. Her connexions may be worse<br/>than his. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt<br/>that they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive<br/>surprize. You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how<br/>peculiarly unprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very<br/>lately more determined against him, much more, than she was<br/>before."<br/><br/>"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley;<br/>"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not<br/>likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told<br/>her he loved her."<br/><br/>Emma could not help laughing as she answered, "Upon my word, I<br/>believe you know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are<br/>you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted<br/>him. I could suppose she might in time—but can she already?— Did<br/>not you misunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things;<br/>of business, shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in<br/>the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?—It was not<br/>Harriet's hand that he was certain of—it was the dimensions of some<br/>famous ox."<br/><br/>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley<br/>and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's<br/>feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so<br/>recently passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those<br/>words, spoken with such emphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to<br/>think of Robert Martin," that she was really expecting the<br/>intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. It could not be<br/>otherwise.<br/><br/>
