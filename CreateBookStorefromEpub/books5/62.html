<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in<br/>Emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.<br/>The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand, that<br/>first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth<br/>her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay<br/>at Hartfield it was not to be expected—she did not herself expect—<br/>that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be<br/>afforded by her to the lovers. They might advance rapidly if they<br/>would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they<br/>would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There<br/>are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for<br/>themselves.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual<br/>absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the<br/>usual interest. Till this year, every long vacation since their<br/>marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but<br/>all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for<br/>the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been<br/>seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by<br/>Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,<br/>even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most<br/>nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short<br/>visit.<br/><br/>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a<br/>little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to<br/>bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms<br/>were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and<br/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent<br/>number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The<br/>bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,<br/>welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,<br/>produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have<br/>borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for<br/>this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were<br/>so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal<br/>solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for<br/>their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the<br/>eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could<br/>possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were<br/>never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in themselves<br/>or in any restless attendance on them.<br/><br/>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of<br/>gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and<br/>affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating<br/>mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but<br/>for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.<br/>She could never see a fault in any of them. She was not a woman of<br/>strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of<br/>her father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was<br/>delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,<br/>had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr.<br/>Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry. They were<br/>alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit<br/>of regard for every old acquaintance.<br/><br/>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever<br/>man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his<br/>private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his<br/>being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of<br/>humour. He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably<br/>cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his<br/>great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was<br/>hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be<br/>increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He<br/>had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and<br/>he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.<br/><br/>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law.<br/>Nothing wrong in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the<br/>little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.<br/>Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been<br/>flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a<br/>calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without<br/>blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have<br/>made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which<br/>he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards<br/>her father. There he had not always the patience that could have<br/>been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were<br/>sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort<br/>equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John<br/>Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and<br/>generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too<br/>often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of<br/>apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not.<br/>The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the<br/>properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be<br/>hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long<br/>seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of<br/>the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad<br/>change at Hartfield since she had been there last.<br/><br/>
