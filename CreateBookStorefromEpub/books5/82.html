<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank<br/>his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his<br/>three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the<br/>lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr.<br/>Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations<br/>of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an<br/>augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first<br/>to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.<br/>He joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation,<br/>seated himself between them.<br/><br/>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind<br/>by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget<br/>his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as<br/>before, and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready<br/>to listen with most friendly smiles.<br/><br/>He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—<br/>her fair, lovely, amiable friend. "Did she know?—had she heard any<br/>thing about her, since their being at Randalls?— he felt much<br/>anxiety—he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed<br/>him considerably." And in this style he talked on for some time<br/>very properly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether<br/>sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was<br/>quite in charity with him.<br/><br/>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once<br/>as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her<br/>account, than on Harriet's—more anxious that she should escape the<br/>infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint.<br/>He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from<br/>visiting the sick-chamber again, for the present—to entreat her to<br/>promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr.<br/>Perry and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off<br/>and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no<br/>putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her. She was vexed.<br/>It did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence<br/>of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if<br/>real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty<br/>in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her<br/>assistance, "Would not she give him her support?—would not she add<br/>her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs.<br/>Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no<br/>infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise— would not<br/>she give him her influence in procuring it?"<br/><br/>"So scrupulous for others," he continued, "and yet so careless<br/>for herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home<br/>to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an<br/>ulcerated sore throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge<br/>between us. Have not I some right to complain? I am sure of your<br/>kind support and aid."<br/><br/>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great,<br/>at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself<br/>the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too<br/>much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any<br/>thing to the purpose. She could only give him a look; but it was<br/>such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses, and then<br/>left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all<br/>her attention.<br/><br/>
