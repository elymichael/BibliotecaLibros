"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton,<br/>who can have thought of it as I have done?"<br/><br/>"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do<br/>not know how many candidates there always are for the first<br/>situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round<br/>Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an<br/>infinity of applications; every body was anxious to be in her<br/>family, for she moves in the first circle. Wax-candles in the<br/>schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all houses in the<br/>kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you<br/>in."<br/><br/>"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by<br/>midsummer," said Jane. "I must spend some time with them; I am sure<br/>they will want it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of<br/>myself. But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any<br/>inquiries at present."<br/><br/>"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me<br/>trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly<br/>be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs.<br/>Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be<br/>on the look-out for any thing eligible."<br/><br/>"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject<br/>to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any<br/>body trouble."<br/><br/>"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,<br/>and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to<br/>accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A<br/>situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for<br/>you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's<br/>notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."<br/><br/>"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make<br/>no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my<br/>friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all<br/>afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices,<br/>where inquiry would soon produce something—Offices for the sale—<br/>not quite of human flesh—but of human intellect."<br/><br/>"Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a<br/>fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always<br/>rather a friend to the abolition."<br/><br/>"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," replied<br/>Jane; "governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;<br/>widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it<br/>on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know<br/>where it lies. But I only mean to say that there are advertising<br/>offices, and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of<br/>very soon meeting with something that would do."<br/><br/>"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton. "Aye, that may<br/>suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature<br/>you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up<br/>with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,<br/>in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the<br/>elegancies of life."<br/><br/>"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very<br/>indifferent; it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my<br/>mortifications, I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer<br/>more from comparison. A gentleman's family is all that I should<br/>condition for."<br/>
