Mrs. Weston was disappointed.

"I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much
pleased."

"Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally
in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My
aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget
her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say
the same. What am I to do?"

"I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only
waiting for my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then
we shall go home. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear
the instrument."

"Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell
should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to
have an indifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to
Mrs. Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable
truth would be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest
being in the world at a civil falsehood."

"I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.—"I am persuaded
that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is
necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is
indifferent. Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's
opinion last night."

"Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very
disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We will go to
Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really
wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention!
and I always thought you meant it."

He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward
him, returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched
them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting
counter,—trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince
her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at
figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would
still never match her yellow pattern. At last it was all settled,
even to the destination of the parcel.

"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.—
"Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at
Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But
then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the
pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly— so
it had better go to Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make
it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?"

"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble
of two parcels."

"No more it is."
