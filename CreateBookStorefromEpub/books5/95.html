"Me!—not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I<br/>do not want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to<br/>acknowledge his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except<br/>what are merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking,<br/>with smooth, plausible manners."<br/><br/>"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a<br/>treasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men,<br/>well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the<br/>virtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a<br/>sensation his coming will produce? There will be but one subject<br/>throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—<br/>one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we<br/>shall think and speak of nobody else."<br/><br/>"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him<br/>conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only<br/>a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or<br/>thoughts."<br/><br/>"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the<br/>taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being<br/>universally agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of<br/>drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general<br/>information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the<br/>lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak<br/>extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."<br/><br/>"And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he turn out<br/>any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow<br/>breathing! What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his<br/>company—the great man— the practised politician, who is to read<br/>every body's character, and make every body's talents conduce to<br/>the display of his own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries<br/>around, that he may make all appear like fools compared with<br/>himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure such a<br/>puppy when it came to the point."<br/><br/>"I will say no more about him," cried Emma, "you turn every<br/>thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and<br/>we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here."<br/><br/>"Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced."<br/><br/>"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My<br/>love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his<br/>favour."<br/><br/>"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to<br/>another," said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made<br/>Emma immediately talk of something else, though she could not<br/>comprehend why he should be angry.<br/><br/>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be<br/>of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real<br/>liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;<br/>for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid<br/>to his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could<br/>make him unjust to the merit of another.<br/><br/><br/>
