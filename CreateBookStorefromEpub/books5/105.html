<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor<br/>resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the<br/>party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on<br/>each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield<br/>again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole;<br/>not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the<br/>room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He<br/>had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great<br/>pleasure in marking an improvement.<br/><br/>"A very pleasant evening," he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse<br/>had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,<br/>and the papers swept away;—"particularly pleasant. You and Miss<br/>Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more<br/>luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained<br/>a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and<br/>sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found<br/>the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you<br/>made her play so much, for having no instrument at her<br/>grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."<br/><br/>"I am happy you approved," said Emma, smiling; "but I hope I am<br/>not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."<br/><br/>"No, my dear," said her father instantly; "that I am sure you<br/>are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If<br/>any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had<br/>been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."<br/><br/>"No," said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; "you are not<br/>often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or<br/>comprehension. I think you understand me, therefore."<br/><br/>An arch look expressed—"I understand you well enough;" but she<br/>said only, "Miss Fairfax is reserved."<br/><br/>
