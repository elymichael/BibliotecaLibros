"Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself,<br/>Mrs. Elton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a<br/>hurry, merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all<br/>coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account—she has not<br/>been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—<br/>so they are all to move southward without loss of time."<br/><br/>"Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"<br/><br/>"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London. a<br/>considerable journey."<br/><br/>"Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther<br/>than from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston,<br/>to people of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my<br/>brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly<br/>believe me— but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London<br/>and back again with four horses."<br/><br/>"The evil of the distance from Enscombe," said Mr. Weston, "is,<br/>that Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave<br/>the sofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she<br/>complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory<br/>without having both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks<br/>a great degree of weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in<br/>town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank<br/>writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary<br/>constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that."<br/><br/>"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I Always take the part<br/>of my own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a<br/>formidable antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—<br/>and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to<br/>sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making<br/>incredible exertions to avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to<br/>her—and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety. She always<br/>travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution. Does Mrs.<br/>Churchill do the same?"<br/><br/>"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other<br/>fine lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady<br/>in the land for"—<br/><br/>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,<br/><br/>"Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I<br/>assure you. Do not run away with such an idea."<br/><br/>"Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as<br/>thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."<br/><br/>Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so<br/>warmly. It was by no means her object to have it believed that her<br/>sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the<br/>pretence of it;—and she was considering in what way she had best<br/>retract, when Mr. Weston went on.<br/>
