"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel<br/>and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself<br/>before their return?"<br/><br/>"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a<br/>situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was<br/>so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to<br/>Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came<br/>congratulating me upon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could not<br/>be before tea, because we were just going to cards—and yet it was<br/>before tea, because I remember thinking—Oh! no, now I recollect,<br/>now I have it; something happened before tea, but not that. Mr.<br/>Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son<br/>wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for<br/>him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now,<br/>poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic<br/>gout in his joints— I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane,<br/>I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to talk<br/>to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do<br/>himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every<br/>thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without<br/>some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John<br/>ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise<br/>having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to<br/>Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that<br/>Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton."<br/><br/>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new<br/>this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible<br/>that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no<br/>consequence.<br/><br/>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being<br/>the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge<br/>of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over<br/>from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill—<br/>which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and<br/>that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,<br/>upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only<br/>wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;<br/>but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,<br/>without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,<br/>Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the<br/>ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good<br/>pace, and driving very steady.<br/><br/>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,<br/>and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject<br/>which already engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs.<br/>Churchill's importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck<br/>her; one was every thing, the other nothing—and she sat musing on<br/>the difference of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what<br/>her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying,<br/><br/>"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to<br/>become of that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just<br/>now.— `You must go,' said she. `You and I must part. You will have<br/>no business here.—Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it<br/>houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it<br/>to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my<br/>difficulties.'— And to this day, I do believe, she knows not<br/>whether it was his present or his daughter's."<br/><br/>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the<br/>remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was<br/>so little pleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her<br/>visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing<br/>that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really<br/>felt, took leave.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
