<br/>"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?"<br/><br/>"Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day<br/>she wanted something from Kingston."<br/><br/>"Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—<br/>Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new<br/>pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."<br/><br/>"Well," said he, in a deliberating manner, "for five minutes,<br/>perhaps."<br/><br/>"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite<br/>delightful; so many friends!"<br/><br/>"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must<br/>get on to Kingston as fast as I can."<br/><br/>"Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you."<br/><br/>"No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and<br/>hear the pianoforte."<br/><br/>"Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party<br/>last night; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—<br/>Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I<br/>never saw any thing equal to it."<br/><br/>
