<br/>"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he. "I<br/>shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will<br/>have my sketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to<br/>read—or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself."<br/><br/>"That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never<br/>go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to<br/>leave England."<br/><br/>"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed<br/>for her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going<br/>abroad. I assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this<br/>morning, that I shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired<br/>of doing nothing. I want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,<br/>whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy—I am sick of England— and<br/>would leave it to-morrow, if I could."<br/><br/>"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a<br/>few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"<br/><br/>"I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I<br/>do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am<br/>thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a<br/>fortunate person."<br/><br/>"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.<br/>Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.<br/>Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,<br/>will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."<br/><br/>"No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best<br/>cure."<br/><br/>"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not<br/>Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in<br/>want of a change. You will stay, and go with us?"<br/><br/>"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the<br/>evening."<br/><br/>"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."<br/><br/>
