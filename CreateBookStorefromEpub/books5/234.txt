"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"

"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and
though I thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she
would not let him off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I,
were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind
friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable,
though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.
Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing—and I cannot say that any of
them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. However, I shall always
think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the
kind friends who included me in it."

"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had
been making up her mind the whole day?"

"I dare say she had."

"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all
her friends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation
that is possible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the
family."

"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every
thing in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the
Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery
establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's
acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!—A style of
living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as to the children, except
the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant
sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with such regard and
kindness!— It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.—And
her salary!— I really cannot venture to name her salary to you,
Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would
hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like
Jane."

"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what
I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the
amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such
occasions, dearly earned."

"You are so noble in your ideas!"

"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"

"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a
fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does
not know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her
thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any
more."
