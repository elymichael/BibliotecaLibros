<br/>"There is no necessity for my calling this morning," said the<br/>young man; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree<br/>of acquaintance at Weymouth which—"<br/><br/>"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be<br/>done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint,<br/>Frank; any want of attention to her here should be carefully<br/>avoided. You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of<br/>every body she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old<br/>grandmother, who has barely enough to live on. If you do not call<br/>early it will be a slight."<br/><br/>The son looked convinced.<br/><br/>"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she is<br/>a very elegant young woman."<br/><br/>He agreed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as inclined her<br/>almost to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very<br/>distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane<br/>Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.<br/><br/>"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,"<br/>said she, "I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;<br/>see her and hear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,<br/>for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue."<br/><br/>"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?" said<br/>Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;<br/>"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very<br/>agreeable young lady. She is staying here on a visit to her<br/>grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my<br/>life. They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of<br/>my servants shall go with you to shew you the way."<br/><br/>"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct<br/>me."<br/><br/>"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the<br/>Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great<br/>many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very<br/>dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can<br/>tell you where you had best cross the street."<br/><br/>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he<br/>could, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, "My<br/>good friend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of<br/>water when he sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there<br/>from the Crown in a hop, step, and jump."<br/><br/>
