<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the<br/>inclination of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should<br/>share with him in Isabella's first day. Emma's sense of right<br/>however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was<br/>due to each brother, she had particular pleasure, from the<br/>circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and<br/>herself, in procuring him the proper invitation.<br/><br/>She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it<br/>was time to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. She certainly<br/>had not been in the wrong, and he would never own that he had.<br/>Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear<br/>to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might<br/>rather assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into<br/>the room she had one of the children with her—the youngest, a nice<br/>little girl about eight months old, who was now making her first<br/>visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's<br/>arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave looks and short<br/>questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way,<br/>and to take the child out of her arms with all the<br/>unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends<br/>again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction,<br/>and then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was<br/>admiring the baby,<br/><br/>"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and<br/>nieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very<br/>different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never<br/>disagree."<br/><br/>"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men<br/>and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your<br/>dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,<br/>we might always think alike."<br/><br/>"To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in<br/>the wrong."<br/><br/>"Yes," said he, smiling—"and reason good. I was sixteen years<br/>old when you were born."<br/><br/>
