He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.<br/><br/>"In short," said he, "perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can<br/>hardly be quite without suspicion"—<br/><br/>He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly<br/>knew what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something<br/>absolutely serious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to<br/>speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly<br/>said,<br/><br/>"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your<br/>visit, then"—<br/><br/>He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably<br/>reflecting on what she had said, and trying to understand the<br/>manner. She heard him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he<br/>had cause to sigh. He could not believe her to be encouraging him.<br/>A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more<br/>determined manner said,<br/><br/>"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be<br/>given to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm"—<br/><br/>He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.— He<br/>was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say<br/>how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?<br/>Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him<br/>composed.<br/><br/>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.<br/>Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as<br/>incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of<br/>foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, "It was time to go;" and<br/>the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree,<br/>to take leave.<br/><br/>"I shall hear about you all," said he; "that is my chief<br/>consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among<br/>you. I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been<br/>so kind as to promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female<br/>correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent!—she<br/>will tell me every thing. In her letters I shall be at dear<br/>Highbury again."<br/><br/>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest "Good-bye,"<br/>closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.<br/>Short had been the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and<br/>Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their<br/>little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being<br/>too sorry, and feeling it too much.<br/><br/>It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day<br/>since his arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great<br/>spirit to the last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the<br/>expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought, the<br/>assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had<br/>been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from<br/>it into the common course of Hartfield days. To complete every<br/>other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her.<br/>What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject<br/>to, was another point; but at present she could not doubt his<br/>having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of<br/>herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her<br/>think that she must be a little in love with him, in spite of every<br/>previous determination against it.<br/>
