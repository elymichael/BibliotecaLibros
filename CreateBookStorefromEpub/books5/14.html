<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very<br/>much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united<br/>causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,<br/>from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the<br/>visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.<br/>He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;<br/>his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit<br/>for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.<br/>Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same<br/>parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr.<br/>Knightley, comprehended many such. Not unfrequently, through Emma's<br/>persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with<br/>him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he<br/>fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely<br/>an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table<br/>for him.<br/><br/>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr.<br/>Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without<br/>liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his<br/>own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr.<br/>Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter,<br/>was in no danger of being thrown away.<br/><br/>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of<br/>whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies<br/>almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and<br/>who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse<br/>thought it no hardship for either James or the horses. Had it taken<br/>place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.<br/><br/>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very<br/>old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived<br/>with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered<br/>with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under<br/>such untoward circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a<br/>most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,<br/>handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst<br/>predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and<br/>she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,<br/>or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. She had<br/>never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed<br/>without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care<br/>of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as<br/>far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no<br/>one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will and<br/>contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,<br/>was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every<br/>body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and<br/>surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many<br/>good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing.<br/>The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and<br/>grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of<br/>felicity to herself. She was a great talker upon little matters,<br/>which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications<br/>and harmless gossip.<br/><br/>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or<br/>an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences<br/>of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant<br/>morality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young<br/>ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into<br/>vanity—but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a<br/>reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable<br/>price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and<br/>scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of<br/>coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute—and<br/>very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy<br/>spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty<br/>of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,<br/>and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. It was<br/>no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her<br/>to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked<br/>hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the<br/>occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to<br/>Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave<br/>her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could,<br/>and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.<br/><br/>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently<br/>able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the<br/>power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no<br/>remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her<br/>father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for<br/>contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such<br/>women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of<br/>the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.<br/><br/>
