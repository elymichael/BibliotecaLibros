"I wish," said Mrs. Weston, "one could know which arrangement<br/>our guests in general would like best. To do what would be most<br/>generally pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what<br/>that would be."<br/><br/>"Yes, very true," cried Frank, "very true. You want your<br/>neighbours' opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could<br/>ascertain what the chief of them—the Coles, for instance. They are<br/>not far off. Shall I call upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still<br/>nearer.— And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to<br/>understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.<br/>I think we do want a larger council. Suppose I go and invite Miss<br/>Bates to join us?"<br/><br/>"Well—if you please," said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, "if<br/>you think she will be of any use."<br/><br/>"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates," said<br/>Emma. "She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you<br/>nothing. She will not even listen to your questions. I see no<br/>advantage in consulting Miss Bates."<br/><br/>"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of<br/>hearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you<br/>know."<br/><br/>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,<br/>gave it his decided approbation.<br/><br/>"Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the<br/>matter at once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not<br/>know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.<br/>Fetch Miss Bates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a<br/>standing lesson of how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite<br/>them both."<br/><br/>"Both sir! Can the old lady?"&#160;…<br/><br/>"The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you<br/>a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the<br/>niece."<br/><br/>"Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.<br/>Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them<br/>both." And away he ran.<br/><br/>Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat,<br/>brisk-moving aunt, and her elegant niece,—Mrs. Weston, like a<br/>sweet-tempered woman and a good wife, had examined the passage<br/>again, and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed<br/>before— indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of<br/>decision. All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly<br/>smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and<br/>music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere<br/>trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.<br/>Stokes.— Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had<br/>already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond<br/>his fortnight, which could not possibly be refused. And a<br/>delightful dance it was to be.<br/>
