"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that<br/>already."<br/><br/>"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks<br/>towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might<br/>have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.<br/><br/>"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this<br/>morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what<br/>had happened."<br/><br/>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little<br/>more composure,<br/><br/>"You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you<br/>have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried<br/>to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a<br/>sinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to<br/>blindness."<br/><br/>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious<br/>of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm<br/>drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus<br/>saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,<br/><br/>"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own<br/>excellent sense—your exertions for your father's sake—I know you<br/>will not allow yourself—." Her arm was pressed again, as he added,<br/>in a more broken and subdued accent, "The feelings of the warmest<br/>friendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!"— And in a louder,<br/>steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon be gone. They will<br/>soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for her. She deserves a better<br/>fate."<br/><br/>Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the<br/>flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration,<br/>replied,<br/><br/>"You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you<br/>right.— I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness<br/>to what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must<br/>always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and<br/>do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant<br/>conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in<br/>the secret earlier."<br/><br/>"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"—<br/>but checking himself—"No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am<br/>pleased that you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret,<br/>indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes<br/>the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your<br/>affections were not farther entangled!—I could never, I confess,<br/>from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt—<br/>I could only be certain that there was a preference—and a<br/>preference which I never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace<br/>to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young<br/>woman?— Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."<br/><br/>"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really<br/>confused— "I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you<br/>continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave<br/>such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of<br/>confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we<br/>are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in<br/>confessing exactly the reverse.— But I never have."<br/>
