"How d'ye do?—how d'ye do?—We have been sitting with your<br/>father— glad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I had a<br/>letter this morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a<br/>certainty— he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole<br/>fortnight; I knew it would be so. If he had come at Christmas he<br/>could not have staid three days; I was always glad he did not come<br/>at Christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for<br/>him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall enjoy him completely;<br/>every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish."<br/><br/>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the<br/>influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all<br/>was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and<br/>quieter, but not less to the purpose. To know that she thought his<br/>coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and<br/>sincerely did she rejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful<br/>reanimation of exhausted spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the<br/>freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a<br/>moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no<br/>more.<br/><br/>Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,<br/>which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at<br/>his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;<br/>and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.<br/><br/>"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield," said he, at the<br/>conclusion.<br/><br/>Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,<br/>from his wife.<br/><br/>"We had better move on, Mr. Weston," said she, "we are detaining<br/>the girls."<br/><br/>"Well, well, I am ready;"—and turning again to Emma, "but you<br/>must not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had<br/>my account you know; I dare say he is really nothing<br/>extraordinary:"— though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were<br/>speaking a very different conviction.<br/><br/>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer<br/>in a manner that appropriated nothing.<br/><br/>"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock," was<br/>Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and<br/>meant only for her.<br/><br/>"Four o'clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three," was Mr.<br/>Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.<br/>Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore<br/>a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish<br/>as before. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at<br/>least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to<br/>Harriet, she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile<br/>even there.<br/><br/>"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"—<br/>was a question, however, which did not augur much.<br/>
