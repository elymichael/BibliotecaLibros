<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might<br/>be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a<br/>pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to<br/>be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only<br/>rather pretty, or not pretty at all.<br/><br/>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,<br/>to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and<br/>she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the<br/>business might be gone through as soon as possible.<br/><br/>She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same<br/>room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three<br/>months ago, to lace up her boot, without recollecting. A thousand<br/>vexatious thoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible<br/>blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should<br/>not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only<br/>rather pale and silent. The visit was of course short; and there<br/>was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it,<br/>that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of<br/>the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning<br/>terms of being "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing."<br/><br/>She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find<br/>fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not<br/>elegance.— She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger,<br/>a bride, there was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her<br/>face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor<br/>manner, were elegant. Emma thought at least it would turn out<br/>so.<br/><br/>As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would<br/>not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.<br/>It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding<br/>visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well<br/>through it. The woman was better off; she might have the assistance<br/>of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had<br/>only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how<br/>peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at<br/>once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to<br/>marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must<br/>allow him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as<br/>much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be.<br/><br/>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted the<br/>house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; "Well,<br/>Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?— Is<br/>not she very charming?"<br/><br/>
