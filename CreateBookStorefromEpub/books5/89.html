<br/>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;<br/>and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort<br/>in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father<br/>so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too<br/>wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no<br/>weather could keep entirely from them,â€”<br/><br/>"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr.<br/>Elton?"<br/><br/>These days of confinement would have been, but for her private<br/>perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly<br/>suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great<br/>importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly<br/>cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never<br/>failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always<br/>agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But<br/>with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of<br/>delay, there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of<br/>explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever<br/>perfectly at ease.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
