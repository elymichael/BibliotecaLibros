"Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:— Miss<br/>Taylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My<br/>interference was quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very<br/>natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?— and I am<br/>afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a<br/>disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did you any good. The good<br/>was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest<br/>affection to me. I could not think about you so much without<br/>doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many<br/>errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at<br/>least."<br/><br/>"I am sure you were of use to me," cried Emma. "I was very often<br/>influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I<br/>am very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to<br/>be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much<br/>for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her<br/>when she is thirteen."<br/><br/>"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one<br/>of your saucy looks—`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;<br/>papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'—something which,<br/>you knew, I did not approve. In such cases my interference was<br/>giving you two bad feelings instead of one."<br/><br/>"What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my<br/>speeches in such affectionate remembrance."<br/><br/>"`Mr. Knightley.'—You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,<br/>from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is<br/>formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know<br/>what."<br/><br/>"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable<br/>fits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would<br/>offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it<br/>again."<br/><br/>"And cannot you call me `George' now?"<br/><br/>"Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'<br/>I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs.<br/>Elton, by calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise," she added<br/>presently, laughing and blushing—"I will promise to call you once<br/>by your Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may<br/>guess where;—in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for<br/>worse."<br/><br/>Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one<br/>important service which his better sense would have rendered her,<br/>to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her<br/>womanly follies—her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was<br/>too tender a subject.—She could not enter on it.— Harriet was very<br/>seldom mentioned between them. This, on his side, might merely<br/>proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined<br/>to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some<br/>appearances, that their friendship were declining. She was aware<br/>herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they<br/>certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence<br/>would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's<br/>letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being obliged<br/>to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to<br/>the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.<br/><br/>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could<br/>be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of<br/>spirits, which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist<br/>to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did<br/>not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her<br/>before.— Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if<br/>Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would<br/>not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably<br/>carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was<br/>likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to<br/>come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they could<br/>bring her back.<br/><br/>"John does not even mention your friend," said Mr. Knightley.<br/>"Here is his answer, if you like to see it."<br/>
