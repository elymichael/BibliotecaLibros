Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he<br/>ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to<br/>them again.<br/><br/>"By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of<br/>the party."<br/><br/>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and<br/>satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole<br/>progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who<br/>saw it was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and<br/>defended it through every criticism.<br/><br/>"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she<br/>wanted,"—observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least suspecting<br/>that she was addressing a lover.—"The expression of the eye is most<br/>correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is<br/>the fault of her face that she has them not."<br/><br/>"Do you think so?" replied he. "I cannot agree with you. It<br/>appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never<br/>saw such a likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of<br/>shade, you know."<br/><br/>"You have made her too tall, Emma," said Mr. Knightley.<br/><br/>Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton<br/>warmly added,<br/><br/>"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.<br/>Consider, she is sitting down—which naturally presents a<br/>different—which in short gives exactly the idea—and the proportions<br/>must be preserved, you know. Proportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no!<br/>it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's.<br/>Exactly so indeed!"<br/><br/>"It is very pretty," said Mr. Woodhouse. "So prettily done! Just<br/>as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who<br/>draws so well as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like<br/>is, that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little<br/>shawl over her shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch<br/>cold."<br/><br/>"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in<br/>summer. Look at the tree."<br/><br/>"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."<br/>
