"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to<br/>this letter?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and<br/>speedily."<br/><br/>"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise<br/>me."<br/><br/>"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will<br/>express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of<br/>your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning<br/>must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of<br/>gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety<br/>requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am<br/>persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of<br/>sorrow for his disappointment."<br/><br/>"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking<br/>down.<br/><br/>"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you<br/>in any doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I<br/>have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding<br/>you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had<br/>imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."<br/><br/>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma<br/>continued:<br/><br/>"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."<br/><br/>"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What<br/>would you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what<br/>I ought to do."<br/><br/>"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing<br/>to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your<br/>feelings."<br/>
