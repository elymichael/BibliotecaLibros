<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball<br/>completely satisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within<br/>the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite<br/>of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very<br/>impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to<br/>remain a day beyond his fortnight. But this was not judged<br/>feasible. The preparations must take their time, nothing could be<br/>properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few<br/>days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty—at<br/>the risk— in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in<br/>vain.<br/><br/>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.<br/>His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not<br/>opposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one<br/>solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain<br/>of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's<br/>provoking indifference about it. Either because he did not dance<br/>himself, or because the plan had been formed without his being<br/>consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,<br/>determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording<br/>him any future amusement. To her voluntary communications Emma<br/>could get no more approving reply, than,<br/><br/>"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all<br/>this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing<br/>to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—<br/>Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as<br/>much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over<br/>William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.— Pleasure<br/>in seeing dancing!—not I, indeed—I never look at it— I do not know<br/>who does.—Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own<br/>reward. Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something<br/>very different."<br/><br/>This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It<br/>was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so<br/>indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by her feelings in<br/>reprobating the ball, for she enjoyed the thought of it to an<br/>extraordinary degree. It made her animated—open hearted— she<br/>voluntarily said;—<br/><br/>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the<br/>ball. What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I<br/>own, with very great pleasure."<br/><br/>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have<br/>preferred the society of William Larkins. No!—she was more and more<br/>convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.<br/>There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment<br/>on his side—but no love.<br/><br/>
