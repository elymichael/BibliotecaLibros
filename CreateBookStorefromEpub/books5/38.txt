"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you
would."

Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore
said nothing. He presently added, with a smile,

"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you
that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon
hear of something to her advantage."

"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"

"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling.

"Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with
her? Who makes you their confidant?"

Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a
hint. Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and
she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him.

"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will
soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable
quarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this
summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love
and means to marry her."

"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet
means to marry him?"

"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He
came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about
it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family,
and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to
ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so
early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I
approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of
her being considered (especially since your making so much of her)
as in a line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all
that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert
Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and
very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and
plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his
marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I
had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me that he
could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could
not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him
away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he
would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the
house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This
happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he
would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and
as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely
that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained
by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch."
