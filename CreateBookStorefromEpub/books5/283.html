<br/>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations<br/>may be imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the<br/>prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming<br/>too happy for security.—What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to<br/>grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been<br/>ever so superior to her own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her<br/>past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in<br/>future.<br/><br/>Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her<br/>resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in<br/>the very midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end<br/>of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such<br/>a Harriet!<br/><br/>Now there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would<br/>be a pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert<br/>Martin.<br/><br/>High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,<br/>was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr.<br/>Knightley would soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery,<br/>so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over. She could now<br/>look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which<br/>her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.<br/><br/>In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her<br/>father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;<br/>and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable<br/>persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or<br/>poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.<br/><br/>They arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:— but<br/>hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received<br/>the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was<br/>caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the<br/>window.<br/><br/>"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said Mrs. Weston. "I was just<br/>going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive<br/>this morning. He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been<br/>persuaded to spend the day with us.—They are coming in, I<br/>hope."<br/><br/>In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad<br/>to see him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of<br/>embarrassing recollections on each side. They met readily and<br/>smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to<br/>be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time<br/>such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the<br/>wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing Frank<br/>Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its<br/>proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however,<br/>and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of<br/>subject or animation— or of courage and opportunity for Frank<br/>Churchill to draw near her and say,<br/><br/>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving<br/>message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made<br/>you less willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then<br/>said."<br/><br/>"No, indeed," cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the<br/>least. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and<br/>to give you joy in person."<br/><br/>
