Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,<br/>and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it<br/>pass. She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something<br/>honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the<br/>all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's<br/>disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,<br/>and those to whom it was important.â€”It had a high claim to<br/>forbearance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
