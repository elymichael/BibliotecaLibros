"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can<br/>account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could<br/>not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command<br/>yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget<br/>it."<br/><br/>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,<br/>not at all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own<br/>meaning; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most<br/>injurious, and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as<br/>her friend,— but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be<br/>mentioned at all,—he resumed the subject of his own passion, and<br/>was very urgent for a favourable answer.<br/><br/>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his<br/>inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for<br/>politeness, replied,<br/><br/>"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made<br/>yourself too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any<br/>thing I can express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed<br/>during the last month, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been<br/>in the daily habit of observing—to be addressing me in this<br/>manner—this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had<br/>not supposed possible! Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from<br/>gratified in being the object of such professions."<br/><br/>"Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of<br/>this?— Miss Smith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole<br/>course of my existence—never paid her any attentions, but as your<br/>friend: never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your<br/>friend. If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled<br/>her, and I am very sorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith,<br/>indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss<br/>Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of<br/>character. I have thought only of you. I protest against having<br/>paid the smallest attention to any one else. Every thing that I<br/>have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view<br/>of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot really, seriously,<br/>doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be insinuating)—I am sure you<br/>have seen and understood me."<br/><br/>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—<br/>which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too<br/>completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two<br/>moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's<br/>sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he<br/>joyously exclaimed—<br/><br/>"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting<br/>silence. It confesses that you have long understood me."<br/><br/>"No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing. So far from<br/>having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error<br/>with respect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am<br/>very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings—<br/>Nothing could be farther from my wishes—your attachment to my<br/>friend Harriet—your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me<br/>great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:<br/>but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,<br/>I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your<br/>visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to<br/>recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?—that you have never<br/>thought seriously of her?"<br/><br/>"Never, madam," cried he, affronted in his turn: "never, I<br/>assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very<br/>good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably<br/>settled. I wish her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men<br/>who might not object to—Every body has their level: but as for<br/>myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss. I need not so<br/>totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to<br/>Miss Smith!— No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for<br/>yourself only; and the encouragement I received—"<br/><br/>"Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been<br/>entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the<br/>admirer of my friend. In no other light could you have been more to<br/>me than a common acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is<br/>well that the mistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour<br/>continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of<br/>your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the<br/>very great inequality which you are so sensible of. But, as it is,<br/>the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I<br/>have no thoughts of matrimony at present."<br/><br/>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to<br/>invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and<br/>mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few<br/>minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to<br/>a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have<br/>been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left<br/>no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing<br/>when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,<br/>they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and<br/>he was out before another syllable passed.—Emma then felt it<br/>indispensable to wish him a good night. The compliment was just<br/>returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation<br/>of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.<br/>
