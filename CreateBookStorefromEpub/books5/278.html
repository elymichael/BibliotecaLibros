The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other<br/>persons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was<br/>sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having<br/>it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the<br/>cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at<br/>Randalls.— But how to break it to her father at last!—She had bound<br/>herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or<br/>when it came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she<br/>must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,<br/>and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She was forced to<br/>speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a more<br/>decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She<br/>must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she<br/>could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and<br/>then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation<br/>could be obtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no<br/>difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—<br/>she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield<br/>would receive the constant addition of that person's company whom<br/>she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in<br/>the world.<br/><br/>Poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he<br/>tried earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more<br/>than once, of having always said she would never marry, and assured<br/>that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and<br/>told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do.<br/>Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be<br/>so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston,<br/>whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a<br/>melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should<br/>be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or<br/>their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he<br/>would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always<br/>at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.—Did he not love<br/>Mr. Knightley very much?— He would not deny that he did, she was<br/>sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.<br/>Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his<br/>letters, who so glad to assist him?— Who so cheerful, so attentive,<br/>so attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the<br/>spot?—Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there<br/>too often; he should be glad to see him every day;—but they did see<br/>him every day as it was.—Why could not they go on as they had<br/>done?<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was<br/>overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do<br/>the rest.— To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr.<br/>Knightley's, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind<br/>of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every<br/>fair occasion.— They had all the assistance which Isabella could<br/>give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was<br/>ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most<br/>serviceable light—first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good<br/>one— well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two<br/>recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.—It was agreed upon, as<br/>what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided<br/>assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some<br/>feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that<br/>some time or other— in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be<br/>so very bad if the marriage did take place.<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that<br/>she said to him in favour of the event.—She had been extremely<br/>surprized, never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to<br/>her; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had<br/>no scruple in urging him to the utmost.—She had such a regard for<br/>Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and<br/>it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a<br/>connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,<br/>so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed<br/>as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other<br/>creature, and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in<br/>not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.—How very few of<br/>those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced<br/>their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr. Knightley could know<br/>and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement<br/>desirable!— The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had<br/>been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage<br/>between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and<br/>Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr.<br/>Weston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish<br/>the subject better than by saying—"Those matters will take care of<br/>themselves; the young people will find a way." But here there was<br/>nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It<br/>was all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth<br/>the name. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in<br/>itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or<br/>delay it.<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such<br/>reflections as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.<br/>If any thing could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the<br/>baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps.<br/><br/>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr.<br/>Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were<br/>enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.— He saw<br/>the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the<br/>constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;<br/>and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had<br/>always foreseen it.<br/><br/>"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he. "These matters are<br/>always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.<br/>Only let me be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has<br/>any suspicion."<br/><br/>He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on<br/>that point. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his<br/>eldest daughter?—he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it<br/>passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,<br/>immediately afterwards. It was no more than the principals were<br/>prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known<br/>at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking<br/>of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with<br/>great sagacity.<br/><br/>In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think<br/>him, and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might<br/>recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for<br/>the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among<br/>their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious<br/>objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.—There,<br/>the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared<br/>little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped "the young<br/>lady's pride would now be contented;" and supposed "she had always<br/>meant to catch Knightley if she could;" and, on the point of living<br/>at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, "Rather he than I!"— But Mrs.<br/>Elton was very much discomposed indeed.—"Poor Knightley! poor<br/>fellow!—sad business for him.—She was extremely concerned; for,<br/>though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.— How could<br/>he be so taken in?—Did not think him at all in love— not in the<br/>least.—Poor Knightley!—There would be an end of all pleasant<br/>intercourse with him.—How happy he had been to come and dine with<br/>them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.— Poor<br/>fellow!—No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her. Oh! no;<br/>there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every<br/>thing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that<br/>she had abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan, living<br/>together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who<br/>had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the<br/>first quarter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
