<br/>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same<br/>style; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and<br/>with his own Jane, and his next words were,<br/><br/>"Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—<br/>and yet without being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It<br/>is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair— a<br/>most distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.— Just<br/>colour enough for beauty."<br/><br/>"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly;<br/>"but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for<br/>being so pale?— When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite<br/>forgotten?"<br/><br/>"Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—"<br/><br/>But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could<br/>not help saying,<br/><br/>"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that<br/>time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure<br/>you had.— I am sure it was a consolation to you."<br/><br/>"Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was<br/>the most miserable wretch!"<br/><br/>"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure<br/>it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were<br/>taking us all in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to<br/>tell you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to<br/>myself in the same situation. I think there is a little likeness<br/>between us."<br/><br/>He bowed.<br/><br/>"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look<br/>of true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the<br/>destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much<br/>superior to our own."<br/><br/>
