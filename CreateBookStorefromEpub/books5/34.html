<br/>"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never<br/>happy but at Hartfield."<br/><br/>Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very<br/>much surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash<br/>would—for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it<br/>is only a linen-draper."<br/><br/>"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the<br/>teacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you<br/>such an opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest<br/>would appear valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for<br/>you, I suppose she is quite in the dark. The attentions of a<br/>certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury<br/>yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his<br/>looks and manners have explained themselves."<br/><br/>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering<br/>that people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was<br/>certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted<br/>again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.<br/><br/>"Now he has got my letter," said she softly. "I wonder what they<br/>are all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will<br/>be unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much."<br/><br/>"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more<br/>cheerfully employed," cried Emma. "At this moment, perhaps, Mr.<br/>Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling<br/>how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for<br/>it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own<br/>dear name."<br/><br/>"My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street."<br/><br/>"Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little<br/>modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in<br/>Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is<br/>his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight. It opens<br/>his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it<br/>diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our<br/>nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession. How cheerful, how<br/>animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!"<br/><br/>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
