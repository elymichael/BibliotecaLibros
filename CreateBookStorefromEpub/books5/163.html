<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her<br/>ideas only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was<br/>a good deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in<br/>hearing Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater<br/>pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very<br/>often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter, that she<br/>might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and<br/>what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring.<br/>But, on the other hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy,<br/>nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment<br/>than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he<br/>was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though<br/>thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or working,<br/>forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of<br/>their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing<br/>elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on<br/>his side was that she refused him. Their affection was always to<br/>subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to<br/>mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became<br/>sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in<br/>love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to<br/>quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must<br/>produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own<br/>feelings.<br/><br/>"I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice,"<br/>said she.— "In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate<br/>negatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do<br/>suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness. So much<br/>the better. I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than<br/>I do. I am quite enough in love. I should be sorry to be more."<br/><br/>Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his<br/>feelings.<br/><br/>"He is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very<br/>much in love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his affection<br/>continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be<br/>most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.<br/>Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him<br/>hitherto. No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings,<br/>he would not have been so wretched. Could he have thought himself<br/>encouraged, his looks and language at parting would have been<br/>different.— Still, however, I must be on my guard. This is in the<br/>supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do<br/>not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite<br/>the sort of man— I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or<br/>constancy.— His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather<br/>changeable.— Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me<br/>thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do<br/>very well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good<br/>thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,<br/>and I shall have been let off easily."<br/><br/>When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of<br/>it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which<br/>made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think<br/>she had undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written<br/>letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,<br/>expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was<br/>natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and<br/>local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.<br/>No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the<br/>language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition<br/>from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some<br/>of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to<br/>shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been said<br/>but for the restraints of propriety.—The charm of her own name was<br/>not wanting. Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once, and never<br/>without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to<br/>her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very<br/>last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any such<br/>broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of her<br/>influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all<br/>conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these<br/>words—"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss<br/>Woodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and<br/>adieus to her." This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself.<br/>Harriet was remembered only from being her friend. His information<br/>and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had<br/>been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not<br/>yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls<br/>again.<br/><br/>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the<br/>material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up<br/>and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting<br/>warmth, that she could still do without the writer, and that he<br/>must learn to do without her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her<br/>resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of<br/>a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness. His<br/>recollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it, the<br/>"beautiful little friend," suggested to her the idea of Harriet's<br/>succeeding her in his affections. Was it impossible?—No.—Harriet<br/>undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had<br/>been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm<br/>simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance<br/>and connexion were in her favour.—For Harriet, it would be<br/>advantageous and delightful indeed.<br/><br/>
