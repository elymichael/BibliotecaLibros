She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was<br/>already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had<br/>told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.—About a<br/>fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,<br/>and quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,<br/>which made the information she received more valuable. She merely<br/>said, in the course of some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet, whenever<br/>you marry I would advise you to do so and so"—and thought no more<br/>of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet say in a<br/>very serious tone, "I shall never marry."<br/><br/>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a<br/>moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not,<br/>replied,<br/><br/>"Never marry!—This is a new resolution."<br/><br/>"It is one that I shall never change, however."<br/><br/>After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed<br/>from— I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.—"Oh! no"—and Emma<br/>could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!"<br/><br/>She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she<br/>proceed no farther?—should she let it pass, and seem to suspect<br/>nothing?— Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;<br/>or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet<br/>into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing like such<br/>an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of<br/>hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.— She believed it<br/>would be wiser for her to say and know at once, all that she meant<br/>to say and know. Plain dealing was always best. She had previously<br/>determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the<br/>sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of<br/>her own brain laid down with speed.— She was decided, and thus<br/>spoke—<br/><br/>"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your<br/>resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results<br/>from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too<br/>greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it<br/>so?"<br/><br/>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to<br/>suppose— Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to<br/>admire him at a distance—and to think of his infinite superiority<br/>to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and<br/>veneration, which are so proper, in me especially."<br/><br/>"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he<br/>rendered you was enough to warm your heart."<br/><br/>"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!— The very<br/>recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time— when I saw him<br/>coming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In<br/>one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect<br/>happiness!"<br/>
