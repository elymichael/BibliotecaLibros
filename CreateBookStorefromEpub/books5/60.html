"Oh! dear, no," said her companion.<br/><br/>They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend<br/>was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to<br/>give Emma time only to say farther,<br/><br/>"Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in<br/>good thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if<br/>compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it<br/>has done all that is truly important. If we feel for the wretched,<br/>enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only<br/>distressing to ourselves."<br/><br/>Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentleman<br/>joined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,<br/>were the first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on<br/>them. His visit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting<br/>parley about what could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then<br/>turned back to accompany them.<br/><br/>"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thought<br/>Emma; "to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great<br/>increase of love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to<br/>bring on the declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I<br/>were anywhere else."<br/><br/>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she<br/>soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little<br/>raised on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main<br/>road. But she had not been there two minutes when she found that<br/>Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up<br/>too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her. This<br/>would not do; she immediately stopped, under pretence of having<br/>some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and<br/>stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath, begged them<br/>to have the goodness to walk on, and she would follow in half a<br/>minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time she judged<br/>it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort of<br/>farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the<br/>cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to<br/>fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and<br/>talk to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world,<br/>or would have been the most natural, had she been acting just then<br/>without design; and by this means the others were still able to<br/>keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained<br/>on them, however, involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and<br/>theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from<br/>their being evidently in a conversation which interested them. Mr.<br/>Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very<br/>pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was<br/>beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they<br/>both looked around, and she was obliged to join them.<br/><br/>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting<br/>detail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found<br/>that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the<br/>yesterday's party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in<br/>herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter,<br/>the cellery, the beet-root, and all the dessert.<br/><br/>"This would soon have led to something better, of course," was<br/>her consoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who<br/>love; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the<br/>heart. If I could but have kept longer away!"<br/><br/>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the<br/>vicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting<br/>Harriet into the house, made her again find something very much<br/>amiss about her boot, and fall behind to arrange it once more. She<br/>then broke the lace off short, and dexterously throwing it into a<br/>ditch, was presently obliged to entreat them to stop, and<br/>acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be<br/>able to walk home in tolerable comfort.<br/><br/>"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am<br/>to contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,<br/>but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg<br/>leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of<br/>ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."<br/><br/>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing<br/>could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into<br/>his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.<br/>The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and<br/>looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately<br/>communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed into<br/>it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most<br/>comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she<br/>found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it. It<br/>was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging<br/>the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it<br/>practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.<br/>For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be<br/>protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make<br/>her appearance.<br/>
