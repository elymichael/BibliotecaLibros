"Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any<br/>thing?"<br/><br/>"No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have<br/>valued very much."<br/><br/>She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most<br/>precious treasures on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.<br/>Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.<br/>Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware<br/>box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest<br/>cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of<br/>court-plaister.<br/><br/>"Now," said Harriet, "you must recollect."<br/><br/>"No, indeed I do not."<br/><br/>"Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget<br/>what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very<br/>last times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I<br/>had my sore throat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came— I<br/>think the very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger<br/>with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?— But,<br/>as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply<br/>him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great<br/>deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time<br/>with what was left, before he gave it back to me. And so then, in<br/>my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it— so I put it<br/>by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great<br/>treat."<br/><br/>"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her hand before her<br/>face, and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I<br/>can bear. Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your<br/>saving this relic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the<br/>cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying<br/>I had none about me!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the<br/>while in my pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be<br/>under a continual blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down<br/>again)— go on—what else?"<br/><br/>"And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never<br/>suspected it, you did it so naturally."<br/><br/>"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his<br/>sake!" said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling<br/>divided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to<br/>herself, "Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting<br/>by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had<br/>been pulling about! I never was equal to this."<br/><br/>"Here," resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, "here is<br/>something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable,<br/>because this is what did really once belong to him, which the<br/>court-plaister never did."<br/><br/>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the<br/>end of an old pencil,—the part without any lead.<br/>
