"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home
again."

"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?"

"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—
or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting
engagements continue to increase as much as they have done
lately."

"Increase!"

"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has
made a great difference in your way of life."

"Difference! No indeed I am not."

"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with
company than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come
down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—
When did it happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood
is increasing, and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every
letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at
Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls,
Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great."

"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it
all."

"Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have
less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing,
Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they
are, I only beg you to send them home."

"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence.
Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure."
