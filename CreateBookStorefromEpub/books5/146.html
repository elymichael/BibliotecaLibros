At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,<br/>the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.<br/>Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;<br/>Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every<br/>proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the<br/>highest promise.<br/><br/>"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ," said Frank Churchill,<br/>with a smile at Emma, "the person has not chosen ill. I heard a<br/>good deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness<br/>of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party<br/>would particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either<br/>gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood<br/>himself. Do not you think so?"<br/><br/>Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs.<br/>Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.<br/><br/>"It is not fair," said Emma, in a whisper; "mine was a random<br/>guess. Do not distress her."<br/><br/>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very<br/>little doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began<br/>again,<br/><br/>"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure<br/>on this occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you,<br/>and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the<br/>instrument's coming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows<br/>the business to be going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine<br/>it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or<br/>that he may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite<br/>as to time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?"<br/><br/>He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid<br/>answering,<br/><br/>"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell," said she, in a<br/>voice of forced calmness, "I can imagine nothing with any<br/>confidence. It must be all conjecture."<br/><br/>"Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes<br/>one conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall<br/>make this rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss<br/>Woodhouse, when hard at work, if one talks at all;—your real<br/>workmen, I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers<br/>if we get hold of a word—Miss Fairfax said something about<br/>conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the pleasure, madam, (to<br/>Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for the<br/>present."<br/><br/>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to<br/>escape a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and<br/>begged Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something<br/>more.<br/><br/>"If you are very kind," said he, "it will be one of the waltzes<br/>we danced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not<br/>enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe<br/>you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds—<br/>all the worlds one ever has to give—for another half-hour."<br/>
