"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr.<br/>Knightley.—"Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and<br/>good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility<br/>than Harriet Smith could understand."<br/><br/>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned,<br/>but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to<br/>be gone. She did not repent what she had done; she still thought<br/>herself a better judge of such a point of female right and<br/>refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual<br/>respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having<br/>it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to<br/>her in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in<br/>this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to<br/>talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was thinking. The<br/>result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.<br/><br/>"Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I<br/>hope it will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are<br/>best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of<br/>match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and<br/>projects you have;—and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if<br/>Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."<br/><br/>Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,<br/><br/>"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of<br/>man, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all<br/>likely to make an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good<br/>income as well as any body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he<br/>will act rationally. He is as well acquainted with his own claims,<br/>as you can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome<br/>young man, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his<br/>general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only<br/>men present, I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself<br/>away. I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family<br/>of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all<br/>twenty thousand pounds apiece."<br/><br/>"I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again. "If<br/>I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have<br/>been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep<br/>Harriet to myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could<br/>never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off<br/>while I am well."<br/><br/>"Good morning to you,"—said he, rising and walking off abruptly.<br/>He was very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young<br/>man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by<br/>the sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma<br/>had taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.<br/><br/>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more<br/>indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not<br/>always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely<br/>convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong,<br/>as Mr. Knightley. He walked off in more complete self-approbation<br/>than he left for her. She was not so materially cast down, however,<br/>but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate<br/>restoratives. Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make<br/>her uneasy. The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs.<br/>Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his<br/>own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure after<br/>all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and<br/>in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give<br/>for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her<br/>with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think<br/>or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's friendship<br/>and woman's feelings would not justify.<br/><br/>He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she<br/>considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she<br/>had done, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to<br/>tell herself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the<br/>skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he<br/>had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that<br/>he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what<br/>he knew any thing about. He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton<br/>speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton<br/>might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money<br/>matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to<br/>them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the<br/>influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.<br/>Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of<br/>its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its<br/>overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might<br/>originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of<br/>prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.<br/><br/>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came<br/>back, not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss<br/>Nash had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately<br/>with great delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend<br/>a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss<br/>Nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he<br/>had met Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton<br/>was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till<br/>the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been<br/>never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him<br/>about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,<br/>to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off<br/>his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been<br/>determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed,<br/>that he was going on business which he would not put off for any<br/>inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable<br/>commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.<br/>Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure<br/>there must be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton<br/>only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great<br/>spirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great<br/>deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly<br/>at her, "that she did not pretend to understand what his business<br/>might be, but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could<br/>prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for,<br/>beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or<br/>agreeableness."<br/><br/><br/>
