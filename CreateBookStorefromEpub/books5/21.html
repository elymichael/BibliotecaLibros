<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr.<br/>Knightley, "of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith,<br/>but I think it a bad thing."<br/><br/>"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?"<br/><br/>"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."<br/><br/>"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying<br/>her with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma<br/>good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.<br/>How very differently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any<br/>good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels<br/>about Emma, Mr. Knightley."<br/><br/>"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,<br/>knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own<br/>battle."<br/><br/>"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for<br/>he thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it<br/>only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that<br/>there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.<br/>Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this<br/>case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the<br/>value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of<br/>the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex,<br/>after being used to it all her life. I can imagine your objection<br/>to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman which Emma's<br/>friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her<br/>better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more<br/>herself. They will read together. She means it, I know."<br/><br/>
