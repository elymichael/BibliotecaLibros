<br/>"This was really his," said Harriet.—"Do not you remember one<br/>morning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I forget<br/>exactly the day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before<br/>that evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it<br/>was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something<br/>about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when<br/>he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut<br/>it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another, and this<br/>was left upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on<br/>it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it<br/>again from that moment."<br/><br/>"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.—<br/>Talking about spruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I both saying<br/>we liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it<br/>too. I perfectly remember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just<br/>here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here."<br/><br/>"Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I<br/>cannot recollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much<br/>about where I am now."—<br/><br/>"Well, go on."<br/><br/>"Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say—<br/>except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and<br/>I wish you to see me do it."<br/><br/>"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in<br/>treasuring up these things?"<br/><br/>"Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and<br/>wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong<br/>of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I<br/>knew it was—but had not resolution enough to part with them."<br/><br/>"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I<br/>have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the<br/>court-plaister might be useful."<br/><br/>"I shall be happier to burn it," replied Harriet. "It has a<br/>disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.— There it<br/>goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."<br/><br/>"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr.<br/>Churchill?"<br/><br/>
