<br/>"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me.<br/>But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."<br/><br/>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately<br/>made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes<br/>against the earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go<br/>to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing<br/>her various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever<br/>been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for<br/>Harriet. Her many beginnings were displayed. Miniatures,<br/>half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had<br/>been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do every thing,<br/>and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many<br/>might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.<br/>She played and sang;—and drew in almost every style; but steadiness<br/>had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the<br/>degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command, and<br/>ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her<br/>own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not<br/>unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation<br/>for accomplishment often higher than it deserved.<br/><br/>There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps<br/>the most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or<br/>had there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her<br/>two companions would have been the same. They were both in<br/>ecstasies. A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's<br/>performances must be capital.<br/><br/>"No great variety of faces for you," said Emma. "I had only my<br/>own family to study from. There is my father—another of my<br/>father—but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,<br/>that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very like<br/>therefore. Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear<br/>Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion. She would<br/>sit whenever I asked her. There is my sister; and really quite her<br/>own little elegant figure!—and the face not unlike. I should have<br/>made a good likeness of her, if she would have sat longer, but she<br/>was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she<br/>would not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of<br/>those four children;—there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from<br/>one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for<br/>any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I<br/>could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four<br/>years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any<br/>likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are<br/>coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my<br/>sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping<br/>on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you<br/>would wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently.<br/>That's very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of<br/>the sofa is very good. Then here is my last,"—unclosing a pretty<br/>sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-length—"my last and my<br/>best—my brother, Mr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of<br/>being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would<br/>never take another likeness. I could not help being provoked; for<br/>after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness<br/>of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very<br/>like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but that was a fault on the<br/>right side—after all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold<br/>approbation of—"Yes, it was a little like—but to be sure it did not<br/>do him justice." We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading<br/>him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and altogether it<br/>was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have<br/>it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning<br/>visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then forswear<br/>ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather for<br/>my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at<br/>present, I will break my resolution now."<br/><br/>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,<br/>and was repeating, "No husbands and wives in the case at present<br/>indeed, as you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives," with so<br/>interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether<br/>she had not better leave them together at once. But as she wanted<br/>to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.<br/><br/>She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to<br/>be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and<br/>was destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very<br/>honourable station over the mantelpiece.<br/><br/>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid<br/>of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet<br/>mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.<br/>But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind<br/>her and watching every touch. She gave him credit for stationing<br/>himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was<br/>really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place<br/>himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her to employ him in<br/>reading.<br/><br/>"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a<br/>kindness indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part,<br/>and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith's."<br/><br/>Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in<br/>peace. She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;<br/>any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and<br/>he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up<br/>and see the progress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased<br/>with such an encourager, for his admiration made him discern a<br/>likeness almost before it was possible. She could not respect his<br/>eye, but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable.<br/><br/>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite<br/>enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There<br/>was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,<br/>and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to<br/>give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had<br/>great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at<br/>last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them<br/>both—a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the<br/>other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable<br/>associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to<br/>add.<br/><br/>
