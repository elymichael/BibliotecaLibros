He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his<br/>own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as<br/>his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have<br/>him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most<br/>unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father's<br/>assistance. His father had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a<br/>capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not<br/>in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong<br/>enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly<br/>dear. He saw his son every year in London, and was proud of him;<br/>and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made<br/>Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as<br/>sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and<br/>prospects a kind of common concern.<br/><br/>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a<br/>lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so<br/>little returned that he had never been there in his life. His<br/>coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never<br/>achieved.<br/><br/>Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,<br/>as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There<br/>was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry<br/>drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates<br/>returned the visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to<br/>come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood<br/>that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. For a few<br/>days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the<br/>handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. "I suppose you have heard<br/>of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs.<br/>Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. Mr.<br/>Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he says<br/>he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."<br/><br/>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of<br/>course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a<br/>pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good<br/>sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every<br/>expression of congratulation which her marriage had already<br/>secured. She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived<br/>long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where<br/>the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose<br/>friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part<br/>with her.<br/><br/>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,<br/>without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an<br/>hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma<br/>was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation<br/>than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and<br/>spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through<br/>its little difficulties and privations. And then there was such<br/>comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so<br/>convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's<br/>disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching<br/>season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week<br/>together.<br/><br/>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude<br/>to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her<br/>satisfaction—her more than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was<br/>so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,<br/>was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity<br/>`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of<br/>every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended<br/>by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. But never did she<br/>go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, "Ah,<br/>poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay."<br/><br/>There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of<br/>ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to<br/>Mr. Woodhouse. The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was<br/>no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and<br/>the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all<br/>eat up. His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never<br/>believe other people to be different from himself. What was<br/>unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had,<br/>therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any<br/>wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried<br/>to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the pains of<br/>consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was<br/>an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one<br/>of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,<br/>he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the<br/>bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree<br/>with many—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With<br/>such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to<br/>influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the<br/>cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves<br/>till it was all gone.<br/><br/>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys<br/>being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their<br/>hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
