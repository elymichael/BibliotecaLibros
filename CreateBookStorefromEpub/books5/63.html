"Ah, my dear," said he, "poor Miss Taylor—It is a grievous<br/>business."<br/><br/>"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must miss<br/>her! And dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!— I have<br/>been so grieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly<br/>do without her.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty<br/>well, sir."<br/><br/>"Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that<br/>the place agrees with her tolerably."<br/><br/>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were<br/>any doubts of the air of Randalls.<br/><br/>"Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my<br/>life— never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own<br/>regret."<br/><br/>"Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply.<br/><br/>"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella in<br/>the plaintive tone which just suited her father.<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.—"Not near so often, my dear, as I could<br/>wish."<br/><br/>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since<br/>they married. Either in the morning or evening of every day,<br/>excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and<br/>generally both, either at Randalls or here—and as you may suppose,<br/>Isabella, most frequently here. They are very, very kind in their<br/>visits. Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak<br/>in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of<br/>us all. Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed,<br/>but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do<br/>really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we<br/>ourselves anticipated—which is the exact truth."<br/><br/>"Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as I<br/>hoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention<br/>could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man<br/>makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I<br/>had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as<br/>you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will<br/>be satisfied."<br/><br/>"Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse—"yes, certainly—I cannot<br/>deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us<br/>pretty often— but then—she is always obliged to go away again."<br/>
