"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve<br/>years old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at<br/>various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and<br/>very good lists they were—very well chosen, and very neatly<br/>arranged—sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other<br/>rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen—I remember thinking<br/>it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;<br/>and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I<br/>have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.<br/>She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,<br/>and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss<br/>Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith<br/>will do nothing.—You never could persuade her to read half so much<br/>as you wished.—You know you could not."<br/><br/>"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought so<br/>then;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's<br/>omitting to do any thing I wished."<br/><br/>"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as<br/>that,"—said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he<br/>had done. "But I," he soon added, "who have had no such charm<br/>thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is<br/>spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she<br/>had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled<br/>her sister at seventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella<br/>slow and diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been<br/>mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the<br/>only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother's<br/>talents, and must have been under subjection to her."<br/><br/>"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on<br/>your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and<br/>wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a<br/>good word for me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit<br/>for the office I held."<br/><br/>"Yes," said he, smiling. "You are better placed here; very fit<br/>for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing<br/>yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at<br/>Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as<br/>your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very<br/>good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of<br/>submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston<br/>had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named<br/>Miss Taylor."<br/><br/>"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good<br/>wife to such a man as Mr. Weston."<br/><br/>"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,<br/>and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to<br/>be borne. We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from<br/>the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."<br/><br/>"I hope not that.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not<br/>foretell vexation from that quarter."<br/><br/>"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to<br/>Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my<br/>heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in<br/>fortune.—But Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet<br/>Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could<br/>possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as<br/>knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so<br/>much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly<br/>flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself,<br/>while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as<br/>for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the<br/>acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all<br/>the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough<br/>to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances<br/>have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give<br/>any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself<br/>rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—They only<br/>give a little polish."<br/><br/>"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am<br/>more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the<br/>acquaintance. How well she looked last night!"<br/><br/>"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would<br/>you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being<br/>pretty."<br/>
