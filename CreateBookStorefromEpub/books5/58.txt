"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think of
any tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to
inquire about of his housekeeper—no message from my father."

She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence
of some minutes, Harriet thus began again—

"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,
or going to be married! so charming as you are!"—

Emma laughed, and replied,

"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to
marry; I must find other people charming—one other person at least.
And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have
very little intention of ever marrying at all."

"Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it."

"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,
to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out
of the question: and I do not wish to see any such person. I would
rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I
were to marry, I must expect to repent it."

"Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"—

"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I
to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never
have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not
think I ever shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool
to change such a situation as mine. Fortune I do not want;
employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few
married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as
I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly
beloved and important; so always first and always right in any
man's eyes as I am in my father's."

"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"

"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet;
and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so
satisfied— so smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and
unfastidious— and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body
about me, I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced
there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."
