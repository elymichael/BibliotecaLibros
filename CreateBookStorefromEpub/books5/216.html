<br/>"Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you<br/>can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—<br/>very sorry to check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not<br/>do. There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the<br/>appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar<br/>circumstances—feelings rather of a totally different nature— it is<br/>impossible exactly to explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in<br/>it—but the part which is capable of being communicated, which is<br/>sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration<br/>for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I<br/>presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its being so<br/>on his. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."<br/><br/>She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction<br/>which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would<br/>have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of<br/>his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows<br/>of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did<br/>not meet hers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings<br/>were too much irritated for talking. That he might not be irritated<br/>into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender<br/>habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon<br/>afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and<br/>solitude of Donwell Abbey.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
